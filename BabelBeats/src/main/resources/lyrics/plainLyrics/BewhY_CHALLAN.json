Learn to take a hint man\nI ain't like the vibe some people think they the shit man\nAwesome sounds we'll do it live then ill bring all the hits yeah\nI'll Gently close my eyes and have a sip of something calming\nThe dinero off the table must be why nobody's calling fam\nI wanna be alone today\nBe in undisclosed location\nWay up in the forest climbing trees and getting wasted\nSeeing nature, objective, angelic in form\nThe unbiased beauty either you get me or you don't\nEither this some shit you feel or you've never been alone\nYou got a place to crash for now you used to have a home\nYou've never seen a ghost then awoke to a real nightmare\nYou've never had a toast to one day without them night terrors\nShe let me know what I was on\nWe never saw the night that day\nThese pills in shapes and sizes came and took our pain away\nAfter the laughter we discovered nothing really changed\nWe gave our genius to desire now we fall from grace\nThis is the life i lead\nI'll probably soon just leave\nI'm down on hands and knees\nChoking on air that I breathe"
