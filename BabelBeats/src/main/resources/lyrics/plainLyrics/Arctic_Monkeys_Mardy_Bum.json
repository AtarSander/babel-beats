I thought as much\n'Cause you turned over there\nPullin' that silent disappointment face, the one that I can't bear\n\nWell, can't we just laugh and joke around?\nRemember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah, to get things off the ground\nAnd it was up, up, and away\nAh, but it's reight hard to remember that on a day like today\nWhen you're all argumentative, and you've got the face on\n\nAnd yeah, I'm sorry I was late\nBut I missed the train and then the traffic was a state\nAnd I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate that reoccurs\nOh, when you say I don't care\nBut of course I do, yeah, I clearly do\n\n\nSo laugh and joke around\nRemember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah, to get things off the ground\nAnd it was up, up, and away\nOh, but it's reight hard to remember that on a day like today\nWhen you're all\nArgumentative, and you've got the face on"

    "lyrics": "Yungblud has one request before this interview begins. \u201cPlease, please don\u2019t ask me about when\u2005I\u2005first discovered music,\u201d\u2005groans the 21-year-old in his soft\u2005Yorkshire twang, facepalming and sinking his cheek onto the table while his hair, a complex structure of gelled, colliding strands, almost knocks over the coffee.\nSeconds later, his frown splits in two, making way for a wide, angelic grin that sits as incongruously beneath his kohl-smudged eyes as the bright pink socks peeping out from his all-black attire. \u201cCome on, ask me a question and I\u2019ll answer it honestly,\u201d he says, rubbing his hands together so vigorously sparks could fly. And then, without irony: \u201cBecause you know, I\u2019m just so real all the time.\u201d\nBorn Dominic Harrison, Yungblud grew up in Doncaster around the corner from the Arctic Monkeys, and has taken alt rock by storm with his rebellious, sweary Britpop that, between invigorating guitar riffs and slinky hip-hop beats, treats thorny issues from gun violence and politics to depression and rape to a monthly listenership of 6.5 million streams. At a time where opinion has become something of a hot potato, ready to send Twitter feeds up in smoke and careers along with it, Yungblud\u2019s debut album 21st Century Liability, which he says was for \u201ctoday\u2019s misunderstood youth growing up in confusion, anxiety and fear\u201d, set him apart as one of the few remaining voices to cut through the beige. If anyone could talk about being \"real\" without sounding insincere, this is your guy.\nWhen did you become so outspoken?\nFrom a young age I was always very transparent, and that\u2019s why the kids' mums didn\u2019t like me. I would tell you if I didn\u2019t like your beans on toast. I remember talking about a Mozart song during a music class at school, and I said, \u2018I wouldn\u2019t have done it like that\u2019. I didn\u2019t like the way the chords moved. And my teacher told me to get out. I wasn\u2019t saying it was bad. It was a perfectly incredible piece of music. Fuck me, he wrote it at 13, that\u2019s insanity.\nWhose mum didn\u2019t like you?\nGeorgia Mattison\u2019s mum. Fuck, you\u2019re going to print that. Fine. I would always tell her when I thought she was wrong. And she confronted me in the playground about causing disruption in the classroom. People didn\u2019t understand me because young people were in a box then. But that\u2019s been totally obliterated now. We are so fucking intelligent. People get offended because opinion is a very controversial thing nowadays. People are scared to have a strong opinion because, with social media, almost everyone lives the life of a celebrity.\nYour opinions are on trend though. You\u2019re \u2018woke\u2019.\nA lot of people say things just because it\u2019s trending. And you can tell. You can tell the difference.\nAre people more intolerant in Doncaster compared to London?\nThere\u2019s a lot of neglect up there. There\u2019s still a small minded mentality.\nDid your parents vote Brexit?\nNo, they voted to remain. Thank fuck. I\u2019d have to disown them. They couldn\u2019t come to my shows anymore.\nWhy did you move to London aged 16?\nI wanted to go to art school for a bit. The North can be quite suffocating, especially for a creative person. My dad owns a guitar shop. Everyone always says, \u2018Oh so it must have been easy for you\u2019. But no it\u2019s the contrary, because you want to get away from it.\nDoes your dad play the guitar?\nNo, he\u2019s just obsessed with them. When I put a guitar in his hand he looks at it like it\u2019s a fucking artifact. I smash my guitars up on stage and he cries. He weeps.\nReally?\nNo, not really.\nWhy do you smash up your guitars?\nI don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s just a surge of energy. And anyway, I fucking paid for it. It just feels good.\nWouldn\u2019t it be better to give the guitar to someone who needs one?\nI do, I give the little pieces of it to the crowd at the end.\nBut wouldn\u2019t it be better whole, so that they could play it?\nWell, maybe.\nYour music is often called protest music. How does that sit with you?\nIt just puts me in another box. I hate it. They\u2019re not protest songs, they\u2019re just fucking real. They\u2019re just about real shit. I just think about gun laws and abomination so I\u2019m going to sing about it.\nYour song, \"Machine Gun,\" about a mass shooting, feels very pertinent right now.\nGod, yeah. It\u2019s crazy, and everyone always says it\u2019s just America. Well,  shows it\u2019s not. That song was inspired by a trip to America when I was 18. I was like, \"What, so I can buy an assault rifle, but I can\u2019t buy a can of Stella?\" It was around the time of the  Florida shootings, on Valentine\u2019s Day. I was there for the march, in Atlanta. It just gave me real faith in my generation. But I can write about anything. \"11 Minutes\" was about love. I could write about that plant over there if I wanted to.\nThat needs to be on your next album.\nIt will be. I\u2019ll make it about legalising marijuana.\nWhy did you decide to write about gun crime rather than knife crime, which feels closer to home?\nIt\u2019s true, I remember people strapping on a knife when going out in town. In any working class industrial area this happens. The conversation around guns and knives needs to change. People ask, \"How are we going to stop it?\" You are never going to stop it.\nWhat we can do is we can talk about it and provide outlets for people who feel like they are going to do that. Obviously we can ban guns in the USA. But here it\u2019s about relating to people. We patronise gangs. We look down on them. There is so much aggression towards that part of society. I know a lot of these people from those backgrounds. It\u2019s very easy for people to sit up there and look down on them. But they feel oppressed, neglected and ignored, so they crave this sense of power that they can only obtain in a gang. That\u2019s a fact.\nWe seem to have moved away from using drill music as a scapegoat now.\nThank God. When that came out, I was like, Jesus Christ. That is such a snooty, white person thing to say. \"Let\u2019s blame it on creativity!\" It\u2019s so easy to stereotype things and blame them.\nYour music is very sensitive, particularly on issues such as mental health. Do you struggle with your mental health?\nI\u2019d been living with anxiety since I was 16 but I didn\u2019t realise I had it until I met my guitar player when I was 18. His mum realised that he had it because she had it.\nHow does your anxiety manifest itself?\nI would wake up in the morning with a knot in my stomach. I would stay in bed all day. People around me in art school idolised someone that was close to me, and that made me feel so irrelevant. I went through phases of thinking I didn\u2019t fit in. I didn\u2019t fit in at home, I was supposed to fit into art school as an artist but I didn\u2019t. So I thought, \"maybe I\u2019m gay,\" because I\u2019ve been called a poof by my whole life.\nAll this shit was going on in my head to try and obtain an identity. I got depressed. I wanted to kill myself. It\u2019s so odd that mental state you get into. It was like I was watching myself on a reality TV show. That\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to do with my music. To say it\u2019s OK to think this. And to give someone a place to belong. If you\u2019re scared, so am I.\nDid you see a therapist?\nNo, I found Yungblud. I found music. I found a manager who saw me playing s--- pop music. I even did a Disney show .\nHow difficult is it to express these kind of feelings as a man?\nWell, depression and suicide is the biggest killer of men. My song \"Kill Somebody\" is about that. People said, \"Oh is it about Theresa May? Is it about Donald Trump?\" No! It\u2019s about me. I\u2019m talking to myself in the mirror. The other night, I was on stage in Bristol, and I cried my eyes out on stage, because I saw this kid who would normally have been making fun of me.\nI was wearing a dress, while he was wearing a bucket hat, an Adidas tracksuit, sunglasses \u2013 an outfit straight out of the Nineties. He was the kind of guy that would make fun of me for looking like Harry Styles. But he was holding his girlfriend and crying his eyes out at my show. And it made me cry on stage because at the end of the day, it doesn\u2019t matter where you\u2019re from and what you\u2019re wearing, everyone is in search of identity. I was helping him.\nThe conversation about male mental health isn\u2019t moving fast enough.\nThat\u2019s so funny you say that because that\u2019s what I\u2019m writing about on the new album.\nYour music was used on the controversial Netflix show 13 Reasons Why, about a young girl\u2019s suicide. What did you make of the show?\nIt was wicked. I think it was very important.\nYou don\u2019t think it romanticised self-harm?\nI hear you, but for me, it didn\u2019t romanticise anything, it does what all good art should do, which is educate people on a subject they didn\u2019t know about. I suffer from anxiety and depression. And yes the show was uncomfortable and triggering at times, but you know what\u2019s more uncomfortable? Someone who doesn\u2019t understand you. Someone who tells you you\u2019re going through a phase and to have a cup of tea.\nIt was a debate that I wrote about recently around the rise of 'sad rap' and the melancholy music of artists like Billie Eilish, which sometimes leads fans to feel competitive over who suffers from worse mental health in her YouTube comments.\nThat\u2019s her fans, not the artist. She can\u2019t control them or how they represent her. I love Billie, we\u2019re good mates actually. I agree it can come across like her music romanticises sadness, but that\u2019s just the way she talks. That\u2019s how she expresses herself. And I know Billie. The songs wallow because that\u2019s what she's going through at the time. Not every song can be \"Live Forever\" by Oasis. That\u2019s why people had a problem with Kurt Cobain.\nBut then again Lil Peep did glamourise the use of Xanax.\nI know he did. But that\u2019s how culture was. And that was his view on the world. I do not condone that but what right do I have to say that he was wrong? That\u2019s his opinion. It\u2019s a fine line but it\u2019s his opinion. I always make sure I stay clued into culture, so that I can write about it. I remember once, in my English class, I was writing a GCSE essay about the desert. And my teacher said, \u2018Why are you writing about the desert. You\u2019ve never been to the desert.\u2019 And I realised he was right. So I wrote about Kampsell fish and chip shop, about how the stale vinegar frazzled my tongue. And I got an A*.\nWas your song \"Polygraph Eyes,\" about rape and consent, inspired by what you saw back home?\nYes, I would see drunk girls stumbling out of nightclubs with boys that weren\u2019t nearly as drunk as them. The messed up thing was I didn\u2019t realise how wrong it was until I moved to London. That\u2019s why I wrote \"Polygraph Eyes,\" which is about a girl who got taken advantage of by a boy who drugged her and kept getting her drunk. The boyfriend couldn\u2019t understand, because he thought she cheated on him. It\u2019s so funny to see when I introduce the song at a show, the number of lads wearing Fred Perry or Hollister shirts going \u2018Fucking yes!!!\u2019\nThere\u2019s a lot of controversy in music at the moment, what with the sexual abuse allegations against Ryan Adams, R Kelly and Michael Jackson. Do you believe we can separate art from the artist?\nAbsolutely not. Music is a part of someone\u2019s soul. Music is a feeling for me. And if that soul is evil, then I don\u2019t want anything to do with it. Why would I want to listen to the opinions of a paedophile? I wouldn\u2019t watch a Hitler speech and get off on it, would I? It\u2019s the exact equivalent. Art is a view on life.\nSo you won\u2019t listen to Jackson ever again?\nNo.\nWas he an influence on you?\nNot really. I had a massive respect for what he did though. But let\u2019s talk about the Lostprophets. . I loved \"Rooftops\" when I was 12. I used to paint my nails because of that song. But if I hear that song now I turn it off because I\u2019m ashamed. That was a person I confided in, that I believed in, but he was truly evil. And that is my bad.\nWhat about someone like Kevin Spacey in House of Cards? Would you watch that?\nThat\u2019s different. Because he\u2019s playing a character. I might be turned off by it but that character didn\u2019t pour out of them. It didn\u2019t pour out of their heart and their head and the way that they think.\nHave you ever been caught up in the grey area of consent?\nNo, not really, man. Because I\u2019ve got two younger sisters and my mum was really strong on it. She said \"You never touch anyone if they don\u2019t want to be touched. Not even just sexually. If someone doesn\u2019t want to talk to you, by staying there, you are abusing someone.\"\nWould you intervene if you saw any of your friends being inappropriate?\nI\u2019d fucking kill them. I am bad for that. I had anger when I was younger. Look at my lips. . That\u2019s why they\u2019re so big. I look like Mick Jagger.  I would get aggressive if I saw someone getting pushed over or something like that. Because I think of someone doing that to my sister and I get mad. It might be a bit outdated now; a bit over masculine. But I had a lot more girl friends growing up. I\u2019m actually quite feminine. I\u2019m a mummy\u2019s boy.\nHow did you realise you weren\u2019t gay?\nTo put it bluntly, I just really loved kissing women and having sex with women. But you know, if the right opportunity comes along... I have been attracted to guys. I\u2019ve just never had sex with a guy. I\u2019m quite a sexual person.\nWhere did you meet American singer Halsey, your collaborator on \"11 Minutes?\"\nIn LA. In a cool bar which I\u2019m not giving away because it\u2019s our little secret.\nWhat did you talk about?\nWe\u2019re from basically the same place but from other sides of the world. She\u2019s from the Doncaster of the USA .\nDid you know of her before she reached out to you on Instagram a few months ago? .\nYeah, I had always admired her as an artist. We had a lot in common, instantly. There was a fucking ignition between us.\nSo she is your girlfriend?\n I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking about.\nSo you just have \u2018platonic ignition\u2019?\nYeah, chemistry as artists. .\nI don\u2019t believe you.\nShe\u2019s wicked. She makes me smile. A lot. I\u2019ll let you have that.\nWhat is \"I Love You, Will You Marry Me\" about?\nIt\u2019s about two lovers in the North of England. About a young man called Jason who met a girl Clare on the Park Hill Estate, which is a really run-down estate. I grew up 20 minutes from there, and whenever I went to see the Arctic Monkeys I would go past it. It was gorgeous in the Sixties, and if you were posh you would live there. But by the Nineties it was so run-down and lawless. The police wouldn\u2019t go up there because there was so much drugs and prostitution.\nThey fell in love and he wanted to propose to her. So this estate\u2019s tower blocks are held together by bridges, and one night Jason suspended himself over the bridge and spray painted, \"I Love You, Will You Marry Me?\" So it\u2019s a lovely story.\nHowever, she had kids, and Social Services said he wasn\u2019t fit to be a father. And then she died of cancer and he became homeless. So property developers redeveloped the apartments and used that story as a selling tool. They put it in neon lights, put it on T-Shirts, and a brewery nearby even made an \"I Love You, Will You Marry Me\" beer. It was even on the sofa pillows inside the flat.\nJason asked for them to take the sign down because it was so painful to be reminded of it and the developers said no. And so, because he was homeless he said, \"OK, will you give me a flat, since you\u2019re making so much money off this?\" And they said no. It\u2019s my comment on corporate companies taking advantage of something as precious as love.\nHow do you come up with these ideas?\nI don\u2019t know. I was in London, and my mate was on the phone and I asked him where he was and he said he was by Park Hill, and that\u2019s what gave me the idea. I remember getting out my notebook and writing down the lyric.\nDo you always write with a pad and pen?\nYep. The proper way.\nDo you write a diary?\nNo that\u2019s too scary. I\u2019ve got video cameras following me around all day anyway.\nWhere do you live in London?\nNowhere. I\u2019m a wandering boy. I live on my tour bus.\nHave you had anyone famous on your tour bus?\nOh yeah. Loads of people. We did the Vans Warped Tour so we were all over each other\u2019s buses. I drink alcohol but I don\u2019t really party that much.\nDo you let fans on the bus?\nGod no. That\u2019s a strict no. Anyone could come on the bus, and then want to bring you down. They can say anything. \"He locked me in tour bus and verbally abused me\" ...or anything. And anyway I don\u2019t have a house so that bus is our safe space. But you know what, I love touring. Some of these fucking hipsters are like, , \"Oh my God, touring is so hard, it just really takes it out of me.\" Fuck off. It\u2019s me and two best mates playing music, traveling the world, and talking about what we believe in. It\u2019s the best thing in the world."
