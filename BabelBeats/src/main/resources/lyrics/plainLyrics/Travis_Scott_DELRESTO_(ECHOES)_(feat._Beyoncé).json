In the case of acquiescence or belief, the object is not only apprehended by the mind, but is held to have reality. Belief is thus the mental state or function of cognizing reality. As used in the following pages,'Belief' will mean every degree of assurance, including the highest possible certainty and conviction.\nThere are, as we know, two ways of studying every psychic state. First, the way of analysis: What does it consist in? What is its inner nature? Of what sort of mind-stuff is it composed? Second, the way of history: What are its conditions of production, and its connection with other facts?\nInto the first way we cannot go very far. In its inner nature, belief or the sense of reality, is a sort of feeling more allied to the emotions than anything else. Mr. Bagehot distinctly calls it the 'emotion' of conviction. I just now spoke of it as acquiescence. It resembles more than anything what in the psychology of volition we know as consent. Consent is recognized by all to be a manifestation of our active nature. It would naturally be described by such terms as 'willingness' or the 'turning of our disposition.' What characterizes both consent and belief is the cessation of theoretic agitation, though the advent of an idea which is inwardly stable, and fills the mind solidly to the exclusion of contradictory ideas. When this is the case, motor effects are apt to follow. Hence the states of consent and belief, characterized by repose on the purely intellectual side, are both intimately connected with subsequent practical activity. This inward stability of the mind's content is as characteristic of disbelief as of belief. But we shall presently see that we never disbelieve anything except for the reason that we believe something else which contradicts the rest thing.  Disbelief is thus an incidental complication to belief, and need not be considered by itself.\nThe true opposite of belief, psychologically considered, are doubt and inquiry, not disbelief. In both these states the content of our mind is in unrest, and the emotion engendered thereby is, like the emotion of belief itself, perfectly distinct, but perfectly indescribable in words. Both sorts of emotion may be pathologically exalted. One of the charms of drunkenness unquestionably lies in the deepening of the sense of reality and truth which is gained therein. In whatever light things may then appear to us, they seem more utterly what they are, more 'utterly utter' than when we are sober. This goes to a fully unutterable extreme in the nitrous oxide intoxication, in which a man s very soul will sweat with conviction, and he be all the while unable to tell what he is convinced of at all.  The pathological state opposed to this solidity and deepening has been called the questioning mania (Grübelsucht by the Germans). It is sometimes found as a substantive affection, paroxysmal or chronic, and consists in the inability to rest in any conception, and the need of having it confirmed and explained 'Why do I stand here where I stand ?' 'Why is a glass a glass, a chair a chair' 'How is it that men are only of the size they are? Why not as big as houses,' etc., etc.  \nThere is, it is true, another pathological state which is as far removed from doubt as from belief, and which some may prefer to consider the proper contrary of the latter state of mind. I refer to the feeling that everything is hollow, unreal, dead. I shall speak of this state again upon a later page. The point I wish to notice here is simply that belief and disbelief are but two aspects of one psychic state.\nJohn Mill, reviewing various opinions about belief, comes to the conclusion that no account of it can be given:\nWhat,\" he says \"is the difference to our minds between thinking of a reality and representing to ourselves an imaginary picture? I confess I can see no escape from the opinion that the distinction is ultimate and primordial. There is no more difficulty in holding it to be so than in holding the difference between a sensation and an idea to be primordial. It seems almost another aspect of the same difference.... I cannot help thinking, therefore, that there is in the remembrance of a real fact, as distinguished from that of a thought, an element which does not consist... in a difference between the mere ideas which are present to the mind in the two cases. This element, howsoever we define it, constitutes belief, and is the difference between Memory and Imagination. From whatever direction we approach, this difference seems to close our path. When me arrive at it, we seem to have reached, as it were, the central point of our intellectual nature, presupposed and built upon in every attempt we make to explain the more recondite phenomena of our mental being.\"  \nIf the words of Mill be taken to apply to the mere subjective analysis of belief -- to the question, What does it feel like when we have it? -- they must be held, on the whole, to be correct. Belief, the sense of reality, feels like itself -- that is about as much as we can say.\nProf. Brentano, in an admirable chapter of his Psychologie, expresses this by saying that conception and belief (which he names judgment) are two different fundamental psychic phenomena. What I myself have called (Vol. I, p.276) the 'object' of thought may be comparatively simple, like \"Ha! what a pain,\" or \"It-thunders\"; or it may becomplex, like \" Columbus-discovered-America-in-1492,'' or \"There-exists-an-all-wise-Creator-of-the-world\" In either case, however, the mere thought of the object may exist as something quite distinct from the belief in its reality. The belief, as Brentano says, presupposes the mere thought:\n\"Every object comes into consciousness in a twofold way, as simply thought of   and as admitted   or denied. The relation is analogous to that which is assumed by most philosophers(by Kant no less than by Aristotle) to obtain between mere thought and desire. Nothing is ever desired without being thought of; but the desiring is nevertheless a second quite new and peculiar form of relation to the object, a second quite new way of receiving it into consciousness. No more is anything judged   which is not thought of too. But we must insist that, so soon as the object of a thought becomes the object of an assenting or rejecting judgment, our consciousness steps into an entirely new relation towards it. It is then twice present in consciousness, as thought of, and as held for real or denied ; just as when desire awakens for it, it is both thought and simultaneously desired.\" (P. 266.)\nThe commonplace doctrine of 'judgment' is that it consists in the combination of 'ideas' by a 'copula' into a 'proposition,' which may be of various sorts, as a formative, negative, hypothetical, etc. But who does not see that in a disbelieved or doubted or interrogative or conditional proposition, the ideas are combined in the same identical way in which they are in a proposition which is solidly believed? The way in which the ideas are combined with inner constitution the thoughts object or content. That object is sometimes an articulated whole with relations between its parts, amongst which relations, that of predicate to subject may be one. But when we have got our object with its inner constitution thus defined in a proposition, then the question comes up regarding the object as a whole: 'Is it a real object? is this proposition a true proposition or not?' And in the answer Yes to this question lies that new psychic act which Brentano calls 'judgment,' but which I prefer to call 'belief.'\nIn every proposition, then, so far as it is believed, questioned, or disbelieved, four elements are to be distinguished, the subject, the predicate, and their relation(of whatever sort it be) -- these form the object of belief -- and finally the psychic attitude in which our mind stands towards the proposition taken as a whole-and this is the belief itself. \nAdmitting, then, that this attitude is a state of consciousness sui generis, about which nothing more can be said in the way of internal analysis, let us proceed to the second way of studying the subject of belief: Under what circumstances do we think things real? We shall soon see how much matter this gives us to discuss.\nTHE VARIOUS ORDERS OF REALITY.\nSuppose a new-born mind, entirely blank and waiting for experience to begin. Suppose that it begins in the forms of visual impression (whether faint or vivid is immaterial) of a lighted candle against a dark background, and nothing else, so that whilst this image lasts it constitutes the entire universe known to the mind in question. Suppose, moreover (to simplify the hypothesis), that the candle is only imaginary, and that no 'original' of it is recognized by us psychologists outside. Will this hallucinatory candle be believed in, will it have a real existence for the mind?\nWhat possible sense (for that mind) would a suspicion have that the candle was not real? What would doubt or disbelief of it imply? When we, the onlooking psychologists, say the candle is unreal, we mean something quite definite, viz., that there is a world known to us which is real, and to which we perceive that the candle does not belong; it belongs exclusively to that individual mind, has no status anywhere else, etc. It exists, to be sure, in a fashion, for it forms the content of that mind's hallucination; but the hallucination itself, though unquestionably it is a sort of existing fact, has no knowledge of other facts; and since those other facts are the realities par excellence for us, and the only things we believe in, the candle is simply outside of our reality and belief altogether.\nBy the hypothesis, however, the mind which sees the candle can spin no such considerations as these about it, for of other facts, actual or possible, it has no inkling whatever. That candle is its all, its absolute. Its entire faculty of attention is absorbed by it. It is, it is that; it is there; no other possible candle, or quality of this candle, no other possible place, or possible object in the place, no alternative, in short, suggests itself as even conceivable; so how can the mind help believing the candle real? The supposition that it might possibly not do so is, under the supposed conditions, unintelligible. \nThis is what Spinonza long ago announced:\n\"Let us conceive a boy,\" he said, \" imagining to himself a horse, and taking note of nothing else. As this imagination involves the existence of the horse, and the boy has no perception which annuls its resistance, he will necessarily contemplate the horse as present, nor will he be able to doubt of its existence, however little certain of it he maybe. I deny that a man in so far as he imagines   affirms nothing. For what is it to imagine a winged horse but to affirm that, the horse   has wings? For if the mind had nothing before it but the winged horse it would contemplate the same as present, would have no cause to doubt of its existence, nor any power of dissenting from its existence, unless the imagination of the winged horse were joined to an idea which contradicted   its existence.\"(Ethics, 11, 49, Scholium.)\nThe sense that anything we think of is unreal can only come, then, when that thing is contradicted by some other thing of which we think. Any object which remains uncontradicted is ipso facto believed and posited as absolute reality.\nNow, how comes it that one thing thought of can be contradicted by another? It cannot unless it begins the quarrel by saying something inadmissible about that other. Take the mind with the candle, or the boy with the horse. If either of them say, 'That candle or that horse, even when I don't see it, exists in the outer world,' he pushes into 'the outer world,' an object which may be incompatible with everything which he otherwise knows of that world. If so, he must take his choice of which to hold by, the present perceptions or the other knowledge of the world. If he holds to the other knowledge, the present perceptions are contradicted, so far as their relation to that world goes. Candle and horse, whatever they may be, are not existents in outward space. They are existents, of course; they are mental objects; mental objects have existence as mental objects. But they are situated in their own spaces, the space in which they severally appear, and neither of those spaces is the space in which the realities called 'the outer world' exist.\nTake again the horse with wings. If I merely dream of a horse with wings, my horse interferes with nothing else and has not to be contradicted. That horse, its wings, and its place, are all equally real. That horse exists no other-wise than as winged, and is moreover really there, for that place exists no otherwise than as the place of that horse, and claims as yet no connection with the other places of the world. But if with this horse I make an inroad into the world otherwise known, and say, for example, 'That is my old mare Maggie, having grown a pair of wings where she stands in her stall,' the whole case is altered; for now the horse and place are identified with a horse and place otherwise known, and what is known of the latter objects is incompatible with what is perceived with the former. 'Maggie in her stall with wings! Never!' The wings are unreal, then, visionary. I have dreamed a lie about Maggie in her stall.\nThe reader will recognize in these two cases the two sorts of judgment called in the logic-books existential and attributive respectively. 'The candle exists as an outer reality' is an existential, 'My Maggie has got a pair of wings' is an attributive, proposition;  and it follows from what was first said that all propositions, whether attributive or existential, are believed through the very fact of being conceived, unless they clash with other propositions believed at the same time, by alarming that their terms are the same with the terms of these other propositions. A dream-candle has existence, true enough; but not the same existence (existence for itself, namely, or extra mentem meam) which the candles of waking perception have. A dream-horse has wings; but then neither horse nor wings are the same with any horses or wings known to memory. That we call at any moment think of the same thing which at any former moment we thought of is the ultimate law of our intellectual constitution. But when we now think of it incompatibly with our other ways of thinking it, then we must choose which way to stand by, for we cannot continue to think in two contradictory ways at once. The whole distinction of real and unreal, the whole psychology of belief, disbelief, and doubt, is thus grounded on two mental facts -- first, that we are liable to think differently of the same; and second, that when we have done so, we can choose which way of thinking to adhere to and which to disregard.\nThe subjects adhered to become real subjects, the attributes adhered to real attributes, the existence adhered to real existence; whilst the subjects disregarded become imaginary subjects, the attributes disregarded erroneous it attributes, and the existence disregarded an existence into men's land, in the limbo 'where footless fancies dwell.' The real things are, in Mr. Taine's terminology, the reductives of the things judged unreal.\nTHE MANY WORLDS.\nHabitually and practically we do not count these disregarded things as existents at all. For them Vœ victis is the law in the popular philosophy; they are not even treated as appearances; they are treated as if they were mere waste, equivalent to nothing at all. To the genuinely philosophic mind, however, they still have existence, though not the same existence, as the real things. As objects of fancy, as errors, as occupants of dreamland, etc., they are in their way as indefeasible parts of life, as undeniable features of the Universe, as the realities are in their way. The total world of which the philosophers must take account is thus composed of the realities plus the fancies and illusions.\nTwo sub-universes, at least, connected by relations which philosophy tries to ascertain! Really there are more than two sub-universes of which we take account, some of us of this one, and others of that. For there are various categories both of illusion and of reality, and alongside of the world of absolute error (i.e., error confined to single individuals) but still within the world of absolute reality (i.e., reality believed by the complete philosopher) there is the world of collective error, there are the worlds of abstract reality, of relative or practical reality, of ideal relations, and there is the supernatural world. The popular mind conceives of all these sub-worlds more or less discontentedly; and when dealing with one of them, forgets for the time being its relations to the rest. The complete philosopher is he who seeks not only to assign to every given object of his thought its right place in one or other of these sub-worlds, but he also seeks to determine the relation of each sub-world to the others in the total world which is.\nThe most important sub-universes commonly discriminated from each other and recognized by most of us as existing, each with its own special and separate style of existence, are the following: \n(1) The world of sense, or of physical 'things' as we instinctively apprehend them, with such qualities as heat, color, and sound, and such 'forces' as life, chemical affinity, gravity, electricity, all existing as such within or on the surface of the things.\n(2) The world of science, or of physical things as the learned conceive them, with secondary qualities and 'forces' (in the popular sense) excluded, and nothing real but solids and fluids and their 'laws' (i.e., customs) of motion. \n(3) The world of ideal relations, or abstract truths believed or believable by all, and expressed in logical, mathematical, metaphysical, ethical, or aesthetic propositions.\n(4) The world of 'idols of the tribe,' illusions or prejudices common to the race. All educated people recognize these as forming one sub-universe. The motion of the sky round the earth, for example, belongs to this world. That motion is not a recognized item of any of the other worlds; but as an 'idol of the tribe' it really exists. For certain philosophers 'matter' exists only as an idol of the tribe. For science, the 'secondary qualities' of matter are but 'idols of the tribe.'\n(5) The various supernatural worlds, the Christian heaven and hell, the world of the Hindoo mythology, the world of Swedenborg's visa et nudita, etc. Each of these is a consistent system, with definite relations among its own parts. Neptune's trident, e.g., has no status of reality whatever in the Christian heaven; but within the classic Olympus certain definite things are true of it, whether one believe in the reality of the classic mythology as a whole or not. The various worlds of deliberate fable may be ranked with these worlds of faith -- the world of the Iliad, that of King Lear, of the Pickwick Pacers, etc.  \n(6) The various worlds of individual opinion, as numerous as men are.\n(7) The worlds of sheer madness and vagary, also indefinitely numerous.\nEvery object we think of gets at last referred to one world or another of this or of some similar list. It settles into our belief as a common-sense object, a scientific object, an abstract object, a mythological object, an object of some one's mistaken conception, or a madman's object; and it reaches this state sometimes immediately, but often only after being hustled and bandied about amongst other objects until it finds some which will tolerate its presence and stand in relations to it which nothing contradicts. The molecules and ether-waves of the scientific world, for example, simply kick the object's warmth and color out, they refuse to have any relations with them. But the world of 'idols of the tribe' stands ready to take them in. Just so the world of classic myth takes up the winged horse; the world of individual hallucination, the vision of the candle; the world of abstract truth, the proposition that justice is kingly, though no actual king be just. The various worlds themselves, however, appear (as aforesaid) to most men's minds in no very definitely conceived relation to each other, and our attention, when it turns to one, is apt to drop the others for the time being out of its account. Propositions concerning the different worlds are made from 'different points of view'; and in this more or less chaotic state the consciousness of most thinkers remains to the end. Each world whilst it is attended to is real after its own fashion; only the reality lapses with the attention.\nTHE: WORLD OF 'PRACTICAL REALITIES.'\nEach thinker, however, has dominant habits of attention; and these practically elect from among the various worlds some one to be for him the world of ultimate realities. From this world's objects he does not appeal. Whatever positively contradicts them must get into another world or die. The horse, e.g., may have wings to its heart's content, so long as it does not pretend to be the real world's horse -- that horse is absolutely wingless. For most men, as we shall immediately see, the 'things of sense' hold this prerogative position, and are the absolutely real world's nucleus. Other things, to be sure, may be real for this man or for that things of science, abstract moral relations, things of the Christian theology, or what not. But even for the special man, these things are usually real with a less real reality than that of the things of sense. They are taken less seriously; and the very utmost that can be said for anyone's belief in them is that it is as strong as his 'belief in his own senses. \nIn all this the everlasting partiality of our nature shows itself, our inveterate propensity to choice. For, in the strict and ultimate sense of the word existence, everything which can be thought of at all exists as some sort of object, whether mythical object, individual thinker's object, or object in outer space and for intelligence at large. Errors, fictions, tribal beliefs, are parts of the whole great Universe which God has made, and He must have meant all these things to be in it, each in its respective- place. But for us finite creatures, \" 'tis to consider too curiously to consider so.\" The mere fact of appearing as an object at all is not enough to constitute reality. That may be metaphysical reality, reality for God; but what we need is practical reality, reality for ourselves; and, to have that, an object must not only appear, but it must appear both interesting and important. The worlds whose objects are neither interesting nor important we treat simply negatively, we brand them as unreal.\nIn the relative sense, then, the sense in which we contrast reality with simple unreality, and in which one thing is said to have more reality than another, and to be more believed, reality means simply relation to our emotional and active life. This is the only sense which the word ever has in the mouths of practical men. In this sense, whatever excites and stimulates our interest is real; whenever an object so appeals to us that we turn to it, accept it, fill our mind with it, or practically take account of it, so far it is real for us, and we believe it. Whenever, on the contrary, we ignore it, fail to consider it or act upon it, despise it, reject it, forget it, so far it is unreal for us and disbelieved Hume's account of the matter was then essentially correct, when he said that belief in anything was simply the having the idea of it in a lively and active manner:\n\"I say, then, that belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object than the imagination alone is ever able to attain.... It consists not in the peculiar nature or order of the ideas, but in the manner of their conception and in their feeling to the mind. I confess that it is impossible perfectly to explain this feeling or manner of conception.... Its true and proper name... is belief, which is a term that everyone sufficiently understands in common life. And in philosophy we can go no farther than assert that belief is something felt by the mind, which distinguishes the idea of the judgment from the fictions of the imagination.  It gives them more weight and influence; makes them appear of greater importance; enforces them in the mind; gives them a superior influence on the passions, and renders them the governing principle in our actions.\" \nOr as Prof. Bain puts it: \"In its essential character, belief is a phase of our active nature -- otherwise called the Will.\" \n\"The object of belief, then, reality or real existence, in something quite different from all the other predicates which a subject may possess. Those are properties intellectually or sensibly intuited. When we add any one of them to the subject, we increase the intrinsic content of the latter, we enrich its picture in our mind. But adding reality does not enrich the picture in any such inward way; it leaves it inwardly as it finds it, and only fixes it and stamps it in to us.\n\"The real,\" as Kant says, \"contains no more than the possible. A hundred real dollars do not contain a penny more than a hundred possible dollars.... By whatever, and by however many, predicates I may think a thing, nothing is added to it if I add that the thing exists.... Whatever, therefore, our concept of an object may contain, we must always step outside of it in order to attribute to it existence.\" \nThe 'stepping outside' of it is the establishment either of immediate practical relations between it and ourselves, or of relations between it and other objects with which we have immediate practical relations. Relations of this sort, which are as yet not transcended or superseded by others, are ipso facto real relations, and confer reality upon their objective term. The fons et origo of all reality, whether from the absolute or the practical point of view, is thus subjective, is ourselves. As bare logical thinkers, without emotional reaction, we give reality to whatever objects we think of, for they are really phenomena, or objects of our pausing thought, if nothing more. But, as thinkers with emotional reaction, to give what seems to be a still higher degree of reality to whatever things we select and emphasize and turn to WITH A WILL. These are our living realities; and not only these, but all the other things which are intimately connected with these. Reality, starting from our Ego, thus sheds itself from point to point-first, upon all objects which have an immediate sting of interest for our Ego in them, and next, upon the objects most continuously related with these. It only fails when the connecting thread is lost. A whole system may be real, if it only hang to our Ego by one immediately stinging term. But what contradicts any such stinging term, even though it be another stinging term itself, is either not believed, or only believe drifter settlement of the dispute.\nWe reach thus the important conclusion that our own reality, that sense of our own, life which we at every moment possess, is the ultimate of ultimates for our belief. 'As sure as I exist!' -- this is our uttermost warrant for the being of all other things. As Descartes made the indubitable reality of the cogito go bail for the reality of all that the cogito involved, so we all of us, feeling our own present reality with absolutely coercive force, ascribe an all but equal degree of reality, first to whatever things we lay hold on with a sense of personal need, and second, to whatever farther things continuously belong with these. \"Mein Jetzt und Hier,\" as Prof. Lipps says, \"ist der letzte Angelpunkt für alle Wirklichkeit, also alle Erkenntniss.\"\nThe world of living realities as contrasted with unrealities is thus anchored in the Ego, considered as an active and emotional term.  That is the hook from which the rest dangles, the absolute support. And as from a painted hook it has been said that one can only hang a painted chain, so conversely, from a real hook only a real chain can properly be hung. Whatever things have intimate and continuous connection with my life are things of whose reality I cannot doubt. Whatever things fail to establish this connection are things which are practically no better for me than if they existed not at all.\nIn certain forms of melancholic perversion of the sensibilities and reactive powers, nothing touches us intimately, rouses us, or wakens natural feeling. The consequence is the complaint so often heard from melancholic patients, that nothing is believed in by them as it used to be, and that all sense of reality is fled from life. They are sheathed in india-rubber; nothing penetrates to the quick or draws blood, as it were. According to Griesinger, \" I see, I hear!\" such patients say, 'but the objects do not reach me, it is as if there were a wall between me and the outer world!\"\n\"In such patients there often is an alteration of the cutaneous sensibility, such that things feel indistinct or sometimes rough and woolly. But even were this change always present, it would not completely explain the psychic phenomenon... which reminds us more of the alteration in our psychic relations to the outer world which advancing age on the one hand, and on the other emotions and passions, may bring about in childhood we feel ourselves to be closer to the world of sensible phenomena, we lire immediately with them and in them; an intimately vital tie binds us and them together. But with the ripening of reflection this tie is loosened, the warmth of our interest cools, things look differently to us, and we act more as foreigners to the outer world, even though we know it a great deal better. Joy and expansive emotions in general draw it nearer to us again. Everything makes a more lively impression, and with the quick immediate return of this warm receptivity for sense-impressions, joy makes us feel young again. In depressing emotions it is the other way. Outer things, whether living or inorganic, suddenly grow cold and foreign to us, and even our favorite objects of interest feel as if they belonged to us no more. Under these circumstances, receiving no longer from anything a lively impression, we cease to turn towards outer things, and the sense of inward loneliness grows upon us.... Where there is no strong intelligence to control this blasé condition, this psychic coldness and lack of interest, the issue of these states in which all seems so cold and hollow, the heart dried up, the world grown dead and empty, is often suicide or the deeper forms of insanity.  \nTHE PARAMOUNT REALITY OF SENSATIONS.\nBut now we are met by questions of detail. What does this stirring, this exciting power, this interest, consist in, which some objects have? which are those 'intimate relations' with our life which give reality? And what things stand in these relations immediately, and what others are so closely connected with the former that (in Hume's language) we 'carry our disposition' also on to them?\nIn a simple and direct way these questions cannot be answered at all. The whole history of human thought is but an unfinished attempt to answer them. For what have men been trying to find out, since men were men, but just those things: \"Where do our true interests lie -- which relations shall we call the intimate and real ones -- which things shall we call living realities and which not ?\" A few psychological points can, however, be made clear.\nAny relation to our mind at all, in the absence of a stronger relation, suffices to make an object real. The barest appeal to our attention is enough for that. Revert to the beginning of the chapter, and take the candle entering the vacant mind. The mind was waiting for just some such object to make its spring upon. It makes its spring and the candle is believed. But when the candle appears at the same time with other objects, it must run the gauntlet of their rivalry, and then it becomes a question which of the various candidates for attention shall compel belief. As a rule we believe as much as we can. We would believe everything if we only could. When objects are represented by us quite unsystematically they conflict but little with each other, and the number of them which in this chaotic manner we can believe is limitless. The primitive savage's mind is a jungle in which hallucinations, dreams, superstitions, conceptions, and sensible objects all flourish alongside of each other, unregulated except by the attention turning in this way or in that. The child's mind is the same. It is only as objects become permanent and their relations fixed that discrepancies and contradictions are felt and must be settled in some stable way. As a, rule, the success with which a contradicted object maintains itself in our belief is proportional to several qualities which it must possess. Of these the one which would be put first by most people, because it characterizes objects of sensation, is its --\n(1) Coerciveness over attention, or the mere power to possess consciousness: then follow --\n(2) Liveliness, or sensible pungency, especially in the way of exciting pleasure or pain;\n(3) Stimulating effect upon the will, i.e., capacity to arouse active impulses, the more instinctive the better;\n(4) Emotional interest, as object of love, dread, admiration, desire, etc.;\n(5) Congruity with certain favorite forms of contemplation -- unity, simplicity, permanence, and the like;\n(6) Independence of other causes, and its own causal importance.\nThese characters run into each other. Coerciveness is the result of liveliness or emotional interest. What is lively and interesting stimulates eo ipso the will; congruity holds of active impulses as well as of contemplative forms; causal independence and importance suit a certain contemplative demand, etc. I will therefore abandon all attempt at a formal treatment, and simply proceed to make remarks in the most convenient order of exposition.\nAs a, whole, sensations are more lively and are judged more real than conceptions; things met with every hour more real than things seen once; attributes perceived when awake, more real than attributes perceived in a dream. But, owing to the diverse relations contracted by the various objects with each other, the simple rule that the lively and permanent is the real is often enough disguised. A conceived thing may be deemed more real than a certain sensible thing, if it only be intimately related to other sensible things more vivid, permanent, or interesting than the first one. Conceived molecular vibrations, e.g., are by the physicist judged more real than felt warmth, because so intimately related to all those other facts of motion in the world which he has made his special study. Similarly, a rare thing may be deemed more real than a permanent thing if it be more widely related to other permanent things. All the occasional crucial observations of science are examples of this. A rare experience, too, is likely to be judged more real than a permanent one, if it be more interesting and exciting. Such is the sight of Saturn through a telescope; such are the occasional insights and illuminations which upset our habitual ways of thought.\nBut no mere floating conception, no mere disconnected rarity, ever displaces vivid things or permanent things from our belief. A conception, to prevail, must terminate in the world of orderly sensible experience. A rare phenomenon, to displace frequent ones, must belong with others more frequent still. The history of science is strewn with wrecks and ruins of theory -- essences and principles, fluids and forces -- once fondly clung to, But found to hang together with no facts of sense. And exceptional phenomena solicit our belief in vain until such time as we chance to conceive them as of kinds already admitted to exist. What science means by 'verification' is no more than this, that no object of conception shall be believed which sooner or later has not some permanent and vivid object of sensation for its term. Compare what was said on pages 3-7, above.\nSensible objects are thus either our realities or the tests of our realities. Conceived objects must show sensible effects or else be disbelieved. And the effects, even though reduced to relative unreality when their causes come to view (as heat, which molecular vibrations make unreal), are yet the things on which our knowledge of the causes rests. Strange mutual dependence this, in which the appearance needs the reality in order to exist, but the reality needs the appearance in order to be known!\nSensible vividness or pungency is then tire vital factor in reality when once the conflict between objects, and the connecting of them together in the mind, has begun. No object which neither possesses this vividness in its own right nor is able to borrow it from anything else has a chance of making headway against vivid rivals, or of rousing in us that reaction in which belief consists. On the vivid objects we pin, as the saying is, our faith in all the rest; and our belief returns instinctively even to those of them from which reflection has led it away. Witness the obduracy with which the popular world of colors, sounds, and smells holds its own against that of molecules and vibrations. Let the physicist himself but nod, like Homer, and the world of sense becomes his absolute reality again. \nThat things originally devoid of this stimulating power should be enabled, by association with other things which have it, to compel our belief as if they had it themselves, is a remarkable psychological fact, which since Hume's time it has been impossible to overlook.\n\"The vividness of the first conception,\" he writes,\" diffuses itself along the relations and is conveyed, as by so many pipes or channels, to every idea that has any communication with the primary one....Superstitious people are fond of the relics of saints and holy men, for the same reason that they seek after types and images, in order to enliven their devotion and give them a more intimate and strong conception of those exemplary lives.... Now, 'tis evident one of the best relics a devotee could procure would be the handiwork of a saint, and if his clothes and furniture are ever to be considered in this light, 'tis because they were once at his disposal, and were moved and affected by him; in which respect they are... connected with him by a shorter train of consequences than any of those from which we learn the reality of his existence. This phenomenon clearly proves that a present impression, with a relation of causation, may enliven any idea, and consequently produce belief or assent, according to the precedent definition of it.... It has been remarked among the Mahometans as well as Christians that those pilgrims who have seen Mecca or the Holy Land are ever after more faithful and zealous believers than those who have not had that advantage. A man whose memory presents him with a lively image of the Red Sea and the Desert and Jerusalem and Galilee can never doubt of any miraculous events which are related either by Moses or the Evangelists. The lively idea of the places passes by an easy transition to the facts which are supposed to have been related to them by contiguity, and increases the belief by increasing the vivacity of the conception. The remembrance of those fields and rivers has the same influence as a new argument.... The ceremonies of the Catholic religion may be considered as instances of the same nature. The devotees of that strange superstition usually plead in excuse for the mummeries with which they are upbraided that they feel the good effect of external motions and postures and actions in enlivening their devotion and quickening their fervor, which otherwise would decay, if directed entirely to distant and immaterial objects. We shadow out the objects of our faith, say they, in sensible types and images, and render them more present to us by the immediate presence of these types than it is possible for us to do merely by an intellectual view and contemplation.\" \nHume's cases are rather trivial; and the things which associated sensible objects make us believe in are supposed by him to be unreal. But all the more manifest for that is the fact of their psychological influence. Who does not 'realize' more the fact of a dead or distant friend's existence, at the moment when a portrait, letter, garment or other material reminder of him is found? The whole notion of him then grows pungent and speaks to us and shakes us, in a manner unknown at other times. In children's minds, fancies and realities live side by side. But however lively their fancies may be, they still gain help from association with reality. The imaginative child identifies its dramatis personæ with some doll or other material object, and this evidently solidifies belief, little as it may resemble what it is held to stand for. A thing not too interesting by its own real qualities generally does the best service here. The most useful doll I ever saw was a large cucumber in the hands of a little Amazonian-Indian girl; she nursed it and washed it and rocked it to sleep in a, hammock, and talked to it all day long -- there was no part in life which the cucumber did not play. Says Mr. Tylor:\n\"An imaginative child will make a dog do duty for a horse, or a soldier for a shepherd, till at last the objective resemblance almost disappears, and a bit of wood may be dragged about, resembling a ship on the sea or a coach on the road. Here the likeness of the bit of wood to a ship or coach is very slight indeed; but it is a thing, and can be moved about,... and is an evident assistance to the child in enabling it to arrange and develop its ideas.... Of how much use... may be seen by taking it away, and leaving the child nothing to play with....In later years and among highly educated people the mental process which goes on in a child's playing with wooden soldiers and horses, though it never disappears, must be sought for in more complex phenomena. Perhaps nothing in after-life more closely resembles the effect of a doll upon a child than the effect of the illustrations of a tale upon a grown reader. Here the objective resemblance is very indefinite...yet what reality is given to the scene by a good picture.... Mr. Back-house one day noticed in Van Diemen's Land a woman arranging several stones that were hat, oval, and about, two inches wide, and marked in various directions with black and red lines. These, he learned, represented absent friends, and one larger than the rest stood for a fat native woman on Flinder's Island, known by the name of Mother Brown. Similar practices are found among far higher races than the ill-fated Tasmanians. Among some North American tribes another who has lost a child keeps its memory ever present to her by filling its cradle with black feathers and quills, and carrying it about with her for a year or more. When she stops anywhere, she sets up the cradle and talks to it as she goes about her work, just as she would have done if the dead body had been still alive within it. Here we have an image; but in Africa we find a rude doll representing the child, kept as a memorial.... Bastian saw Indian women in Peru who had lost an infant carrying about on their backs a wooden doll to represent it.\" \nTo many persons among us, photographs of lost ones seem to be fetishes. They, it is true, resemble; but the fact that the mere materiality of the reminder is almost as important as its resemblance is shown by the popularity a, hundred years ago of the black taffeta 'silhouettes' which are still found among family relies, and of one of which Fichte could write to his affianced: 'Die Farbe fehlt, das Auge feldt, es fehlt der himmlische Ausdruck deiner lieblichen Züge' -- and yet go on worshiping it all the same. The opinion so stoutly professed by many, that language is essential to thought, seems to have this much of truth in it, that all our inward images tend invincibly to attach themselves to something sensible, so as to gain in corporeity and life. Words serve this purpose, gestures serve it, stones, straws, chalk-marks, anything will do. As soon as anyone of these things stands for the idea, the latter seems to be more real. Some persons, the present writer among the number, can hardly lecture without a black-board: the abstract conceptions must be symbolized by letters, squares or circles, and the relations between them by lines. All this symbolism, linguistic, graphic, and dramatic, has other uses too, for it abridges thought and fixes terms. But one of its uses is surely to rouse the believing reaction and give to the ideas a more living reality. As, when we are told a story, and shown the very knife that did the murder, the very ring whose hiding-place the clairvoyant revealed, the whole thing passes from fairy-land to mother-earth, so here we believe all the more, if only we see that 'the bricks are alive to tell the tale.'\nSo much for the prerogative position of sensations in regard to our belief. But among the sensations themselves all are not deemed equally real. The more practically important ones, the more permanent ones, and the more aesthetically apprehensible ones are selected from the mass, to be believed in most of all; the others are degraded to the position of mere signs and suggestions of these. This fact has already been adverted to in former chapters.  The real color of a thing is that one color-sensation which it gives us when most favorably lighted for vision. Soon its real size, its real shape, etc. -- these are but optical sensations selected out of thousands of others, because they have aesthetic characteristics which appeal to our convenience or delight. But I will not repeat what I have already written about this matter, but pass on to our treatment of tactile and muscular sensations, as 'primary qualities,' more real than those 'secondary' qualities which eye and ear and nose reveal. Why do we thus so markedly select the tangible to be the real? Our motives are not far to seek. The tangible qualities are the least fluctuating. When we get them at all we get them the same. The other qualities fluctuate enormously as our relative position to the object changes. Then, more decisive still, the tactile properties are those most intimately connected with our weal or woe. A dagger hurts us only when in contact with our skin, a poison only when we take it into our mouths, and we can only use an object for our advantage when we have it in our muscular control. It is as tangibles, then, that things concern us most; and the other senses, so far as their practical use goes, do but warn us of what tangible things to expect. They are but organs of anticipatory touch, as Berkeley has with perfect clearness explained. \nAmong all sensations, the most belief-compelling are those productive of pleasure or of pain. Locke expressly makes the pleasure- or pain- giving quality to be the ultimate human criterion of anything's reality. Discussing (with supposed Berkeleyan before Berkeley) the notion that all our perceptions may be but a dream, he says:\n\" He may please to dream that I make him this answer. I believe he will allow a very manifest difference between dreaming of being in the fire and being actually in it. But yet if he be resolved to appear so skeptical as to maintain that what I call being actually in the fire is nothing but a dream, and that we cannot thereby certainly know that any such thing as fire actually exists without us, I answer that we, certainly finding that pleasure or pain   follows upon the application of certain objects to us, whose existence we perceive, or dream that we perceive by our senses, this certainly is as great as our happiness or misery, beyond which we have no concernment to know or to be.  \nTHE INFLUENCE OF EMOTION AND ACTIVE IMPULSE ON BELIEF.\nThe quality of arousing emotion, of shaking, moving us or inciting us to action, has as much to do with our belief in an object's reality as the quality of giving pleasure or pain. In Chapter XXIV I shall seek to show that our emotions probably owe their pungent quality to the bodily sensations which they involve. Our tendency to believe in emotionally exciting objects (objects of fear, desire, etc.) is thus explained without resorting to any fundamentally new principle of choice. Speaking generally, the more a conceived object excites us, the more reality it has. The same object excites us differently at different times. Moral and religious truths come 'home' to us far more on some occasions than on others. As Emerson says, \"There is a difference between one and another hour of life in their authority and subsequent effect. Our faith comes in moments,... yet there is a depth in those brief moments which constrains us to ascribe more reality to them than to all other experiences.\" The 'depth' is partly, no doubt, the insight into wider systems of unified relation, but far more often than that it is the emotional thrill. Thus, to descend to more trivial examples, a man who has no belief in ghosts by daylight will temporarily believe in them when, alone at midnight, he feels his blood curdle at a, mysterious sound or vision, his heart thumping, and his legs impelled to flee. The thought of falling when we walk along a curbs one awakens no emotion of dread; so no sense of reality attaches to it, and we are sure me shall not fall. On a precipice's edge, however, the sickening emotion which the notion of a possible fall engenders makes ns believe in the latter's imminent reality, and quite unfits us to proceed. \nThe greatest proof that a man is sui compos is his ability to suspend belief in presence of an emotionally exciting idea. To give this power is the highest result of education. In untutored minds the power does not exist. Ever exciting thought in the natural man carries credence with it. To conceive with passion is ipso facto affirm. As Bagehot says:\n\"The Caliph Omar burnt the Alexandrian Library, saying: 'All books which contain what is not in the Koran are dangerous. All which contain what is in it are useless! ' Probably no one ever had an intenser belief in anything than Omar had in this. Yet it is impossible to imagine it preceded by an argument. His belief in Mahomet, in the Koran, and in the sufficiency of the Koran, probably came to him in spontaneous rushes of emotion; there may have been little vestiges of argument donating here and there, but they did not justify the strength of the emotion, stillness did they create it, and they hardly even excused it.... Probably, when the subject is thoroughly examined, conviction will be found to be one of the intensest of human emotions, and one most closely connected with the bodily state,... accompanied or preceded by the sensation that Scott makes his seer describe as the prelude of a prophecy\nAt length the fatal answer came, In characters of living flame-- Not spoke in words, nor blazed in scroll, But borne and branded on my soul.'\nA hot hash seems to burn across the brain. Men in these intense states of mind have altered all history, changed for better or worse the creed of myriads, and desolated or redeemed provinces or ages. Nor is this intensity a sign of truth, for it is precisely strongest in those points in which men differ most from each other. John Knox felt it in his anti-Catholicism; Ignatius Loyola in his anti-Protestantism; and both, I suppose, felt it as much as it is possible to feel it.\" \nThe reason of the belief is undoubtedly the bodily commotion which the exciting idea sets up. 'Nothing which I can feel like that can be false.' All our religious and supernatural beliefs are of this order. The surest warrant for immortality is the yearning of our bowels for our dear ones; for God, the sinking sense it gives us to imagine no such Providence or help. So of our political or pecuniary hopes and fears, and things and persons dreaded and desired \"A grocer has a full creed as to foreign policy, young lady a complete theory of the sacraments, as to which neither has any doubt.... A girl in a country parsonage will be sure that Paris never can be taken, or that Bismarck is a wretch\" -- all because they have either conceived these things at some moment with passion, or associated them with other things which they have conceived with passion.\nRenouvier calls this belief of a thing for no other reason than that we conceive it with passion, by the name of mental vertigo.  Other objects whisper doubt or disbelief; but the object of passion makes us deaf to all but itself, and we affirm it unhesitatingly. Such objects are the delusions of insanity, which the insane person can tit odd moments steady himself against, but which again return to sweep him off his feet. Such are the revelations of mysticism. Such, particularly, are the sudden beliefs which animate mobs of men when frenzied impulse to action is involved. Whatever be the action in point -- whether the stoning of a prophet, the bailing of a conqueror, the burning of a, witch, the baiting of a heretic or Jew, the starting of a forlorn hope, or the flying from a foe -- the fact that to believe a certain object will cause that action to explode is a sufficient reason for that belief to come. The motor impulse sweeps it unresisting in its train.\nThe whole history of witchcraft and early medicine is a commentary on the facility with which anything which chances to be conceived is believed the moment the belief chimes in with an emotional mood. 'The cause of sickness?' When a savage asks the cause of anything he means to ask exclusively 'What is to blame?' The theoretic curiosity starts from the practical life's demands. Let some one then accuse a necromancer, suggest a charm or spell which has been cast, and no more 'evidence' is asked for. What evidence is required beyond this intimate sense of the culprit's responsibility, to which our very viscera and limbs reply?  \nHuman credulity in the way of therapeutics has similar psychological roots. If there is anything intolerable (especially to the heart of a woman), it is to do nothing when a loved one is sick or in pain. To do anything is a relief. Accordingly, whatever remedy may be suggested is a spark on inflammable soil. The mind makes its spring towards action on that cue, sends for that remedy, and for a day at least believes the danger past. Blame, dread, and hope are thus the great belief inspiring passions, and cover among them the future, the present, and the past.\nThese remarks illustrate the earlier heads of the list on page 292. Whichever represented objects give us sensations, especially interesting ones, or incite our motor impulses, or arouse our hate, desire, or fear, are real enough for us. Our requirements in the way of reality terminate in our own acts and emotions, our own pleasures and pains. These are the ultimate fixities from which, as we formerly observed, the whole chain of our beliefs depends, object hanging to object, as the bees, in swarming, hang to each other until, de proche en proche, the supporting branch, the Self, is reached and held.\nBELIEF IN OBJECTS OF THEORY.\nNow the merely conceived or imagined objects which our mind represents as hanging to the sensations (causing them, etc.), filling the gaps between them, and weaving their interrupted chaos into order are innumerable. Whole systems of them conflict with other systems, and our choice of which system shall carry our belief is governed by principles which are simple enough, however subtle and difficult may be their application to details. The conceived system, to pass for true, must at least include the reality of the sensible objects in it, by explaining them as effects on us, if nothing more. The system which includes the most of them, and definitely explains or pretends to explain the rest of them, will, ceteris paribus, prevail. It is needless to say how far mankind still is from having excogitated such a system. But the various materialisms, idealisms, and hylozoisms show with what industry the attempt is forever made. It is conceivable that several rival theories should equally well include the actual order of our sensations in their scheme, much as the one-fluid and two-fluid theories of electricity formulated all the common electrical phenomena equally well. The sciences are full of these alternatives. Which theory is then to be believed? That theory will be most generally believed which, besides bring us objects able to account satisfactorily for our sensible experience, also offers those which are most interesting, those which apiaeal most urgently to our æsthetic, emotional, and active needs. So here, in the higher intellectual life, the same selection among general conceptions goes on which went on among the sensations themselves. First, a word of their relation to our emotional and active needs -- and here I can do no better than quote from an article published some years ago: \n\"A philosophy may be unimpeachable in other respects, but either of two defects will be fatal to its universal acceptance. First, its ultimate principle must not be one that essentially baffles and disappoints our dearest desires and most cherished powers. A pessimistic principle like Schopenhauer's incurably vicious Will-substance, or Hartmann's wicked jack-at-all-trades, the Unconscious, will perpetually call forth essays at other philosophies. Incompatibility of the future with their desires and active tendencies is, in fact, to most men a source of more fixed disquietude than uncertainty itself. Witness the attempts to overcome the 'problem of evil,' the 'mystery of pain.' There is no problem of 'good.'\n\"But a second and worse defect in a philosophy than that of contradicting our active propensities is to give them no Object whatever to press against. A philosophy whose principle is so incommensurate with our most intimate powers as to deny them all relevancy in universal affairs, as to annihilate their motives at one blow, will be even more unpopular than pessimism. Better face the enemy than the eternal Void! This is why materialism will always fail of universal adoption, however well it may fuse things into an atomistic unity, however clearly it may prophesy the future eternity. For materialism denies reality to the objects of almost all the impulses which we most cherish. The real meaning of the impulses, it says, is something which has no emotional interest for us whatever. But what is called extradition is quite as characteristic of our emotions as of our sense. Both point to an object as the cause of the present feeling. What an intensely objective reference lies in fear I In like manner an enraptured man, a dreary-feeling man, are not simply aware of their subjective states; if they were, the force of their feelings would evaporate. Both believe there is outward cause why they should feel as they do: either 'It is a glad world! 'how good is life!' or 'What a loathsome tedium is existence!' Any philosophy which annihilates the validity of the reference by explaining away its objects or translating them into terms of no emotional pertinency leaves the mind with little to care or act for. This is the opposite condition from that of nightmare, but when acutely brought home to consciousness it produces a kindred horror. In nightmare we have motives to act, hut no power: here we have powers, but no motives. A nameless Unheimlichkeit comes over us at the thought of there being nothing eternal in our final purposes, in the objects of those loves and aspirations which are our deepest energies. The monstrously lopsided equation of the universe and its knower, which we postulate as the ideal of cognition, is perfectly paralleled by the no less lopsided equation of the universe and the doer. We demand in it a character for which our emotions and active propensities shall be a match. Small as we are, minute as is the point by which the Cosmos impinges upon each one of us, each one desires to feel that his reaction at that point is congruous with the demands of the vast whole, that balances the latter, so to speak, and is able to do what it expects of him. But as his abilities to 'do' lie wholly in the line of his natural propensities; as he enjoys reaction with such emotions as fortitude, hope, rapture, admiration, earnestness, and the like; and as he very unwillingly reacts with fear, disgust, despair, or doubt, -- a philosophy which should legitimate only emotions of the latter sort would be sure to leave the mind a prey to discontent and craving.\n\"It is far too little recognized how entirely the intellect is built up of practical interests. The theory of Evolution is beginning to do very good service by its reduction of all mentality to the type of reflex action. Cognition, in this view, is but a fleeting moment, a cross-section at a certain point of what in its totality Is a motor phenomenon. In the lower forms of life no one will pretend that cognition is anything more than a guide to appropriate action. The germinal question concerning things brought for the first time before consciousness is not the theoretic 'What is that?' but the practical 'Who goes there?' or rather, as Horwicz has admirably put it, 'What is to be done?' -- 'Was fang' ich an?' In all our discussions about the intelligence of lower animals the only test we use is that of their activity as if for a purpose. Cognition, in short, is incomplete until discharged in act. And although it is true that the later mental development, which attains its maximum through the hypertrophied cerebrum of man, gives birth to a vast amount of theoretic activity over and above that which is immediately ministerial to practice, Set the earlier claim is only postponed, not effaced, and the active nature asserts its rights to the end.\n\"If there be any truth at all in this view, it follows that however vaguely a philosopher may define the ultimate universal datum, he cannot be said to leave it unknown to us so long as he in the slightest degree pretends that our emotional or active attitude towards it should be of one sort rather than another. He who says, 'Life is real, life is earnest,' however much he may speak of the fundamental mysteriousness of things, gives a distinct definition to that mysteriousness by ascribing to it the right to claim from us the particular mood called seriousness, which means the unwillingness to live with energy, though energy bring pain. The same is true of him who says that all is vanity. Indefinable as the predicate vanity may be in se, it is clearly enough something which permits anæsthesia, mere escape from suffering, to be our rule of life. There is no more ludicrous incongruity than for agnostics to proclaim with one breath that the substance of things is unknowable, and with the next that the thought of it should inspire us with admiration of its glory, reverence, and a willingness to add our cooperative push in the direction towards which its manifestations seem to be drifting. The unknowable may be unfathomed, but if it make such distinct demands upon our activity, we surely are not ignorant of its essential quality.\n\"If we survey the held of history and ask what feature all great periods of revival, of expansion of the human mind, display in common, we shall find, I think, simply this: that each and all of them have said to the human being, 'The inmost nature of the reality is congenial to powers which you possess.' In what did the emancipating message of primitive Christianity consist, but in the announcement that God recognizes those weak and tender impulses which pagrtnism had so rudely overlooked. Take repentance: the man who can do nothing rightly can at least repent of his failures. But for paganism this faculty of repentance was a pure supernumerary, a straggler too late for the fair. Christianity took it and made it the one power within us which appealed straight to the heart of God. And after the night of the Middle Ages had so long branded with obloquy even the generous impulses of the flesh, and defined the Reality to be such that only slavish natures could commune with it? in what did the Sursum corda! of the Renaissance lie but in the proclamation that the archetype of verity in things laid claim on the widest activity of our whole æsthetic being? What were Luther's mission and Wesley's but appeals to powers which even the meanest of men might carry with them, faith and self-despair, but which were personal, requiring no priestly intermediation, and which brought their owner face to face with God? What caused the wild-fire influence of Rousseau but the assurance he gave that man's nature was in harmony with the nature of things, if only the paralyzing corruptions of custom would stand from between? How did Kant and Fichte, Goethe and Schiller, inspire their time with cheer, except by saying, 'Use all your powers; that is the only obedience which the universe exacts'? And Carlyle with his gospel of Work, of Fact, of Veracity, how does he move us except by saying that the universe imposes no tasks upon us but such as the most humble can perform? Emerson's creed that everything that ever was or will be is here in the enveloping now; that man has but to obey himself -- ' He who will rest in what he is, is a part of Destiny' -- is in like manner nothing but an exorcism of all scepticism as to the pertinency of one's natural faculties.\"\nIn a word, 'Son of Man, stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee!' is the only revelation of truth to which the solving epochs have helped the disciple. But that has been enough to satisfy the greater part of his rational need. In se and per se the universal essence has hardly been more defined by any of these formulae than by the agnostics; but the mere assurance that my powers, such as they are, are not irrelevant to it, but pertinent, that it speaks to them and will in some way recognize their reply, that I can be a match for it if I will, and not a footless waif, suffices to make it rational to my feeling in the sense given above. Nothing could be more absurd than to hope for the definitive triumph of any philosophy which should refuse to legitimate, and to legitimate in an emphatic manner, the more powerful of our emotional and practical tendencies. Fatalism, whose solving word in all crises of behavior is 'All striving is vain,' will never reign supreme, for the impulse to take life strivingly is indestructible in the race. Moral creeds which speak to that impulse will be widely successful In spite of Inconsistency, vagueness, and shadowy determination of expectancy. Man needs a rule for his will, and will invent one if one be not given him.\"\nAfter the emotional and active needs come the intellectual and æsthetic ones. The two great æsthetic principles, of richness and of ease, dominate our intellectual as well as our sensuous life. And, ceteris paribus, no system which should not be rich, simple, and harmonious would have a chance of being chosen for belief, if rich, simple, and harmonious systems were also there. Into the latter we should unhesitatingly settle, with that welcoming attitude of the will in which belief consists. To quote from a remarkable book:\n\"This law that our consciousness constantly tends to the minimum of complexity and to the maximum of definiteness, is of great importance for all our knowledge.... Our own activity of attention will thus determine what we are to know and what we are to believe. If things have more than a certain complexity, not only will our limited powers of attention forbid us to unravel this complexity, but we shall strongly desire to believe the things much simpler than they are. For our thoughts about them will have a constant tendency to become as simple and definite as possible. Put a man into a perfect chaos of phenomena-sounds, sights, feelings -- and if the man continued to exist, and to be rational at all, his attention would doubtless soon find for him a way to make up some kind of rhythmic regularity, which he would impute to the things about him, so as to imagine that he had discovered some laws of sequence in this mad new world. And thus, in every case where we fancy ourselves sure of a simple law of Nature, we must remember that a great deal of the fancied simplicity may be due, in the given case, not to Nature, but to the ineradicable prejudice of our own minds in favor of regularity and simplicity. All our thoughts are determined, in great measure, by this law of least effort, as it is found exemplified in our activity of attention... The aim of the whole process seems to be to reach as complete and united a conception of reality as possible, a conception wherein the greatest fulness of data shall be combined with the greatest simplicity of conception. The effort of consciousness seems to be to combine the greatest richness of content with the greatest definiteness of organization.\" \nThe richness is got by including all the facts of sense in the scheme; the simplicity, by deducing them out of the smallest possible number of permanent and independent primordial entities: the definite organization, by assimilating these latter to ideal objects between which relations of an inwardly rational sort obtain. That these ideal objects and rational relations are will require a separate chapter to show.  Meanwhile, enough has surely been said to justify the assertion made above that no general off hand answer can be given as to which objects mankind shall choose as its realities. The fight is still under way. Our minds are yet chaotic; and at best we make a mixture and a compromise, as we yield to the claim of this interest or that, and follow first one and then another principle in turn. It is undeniably true that materialistic, or so-called 'scientific,' conceptions of the universe have so far gratified the purely intellectual interests more than the mere sentimental conceptions have. But, on the other hand, as already remarked, they leave the emotional and active interests cold. The perfect object of belief would be a God or 'Soul of the World,' represented both optimistically and moralistically (if such a combination could be), and withal so definitely conceived as to show us why our phenomenal experiences should be sent to us by Him in just the very way in which they come. All Science and all History would thus be accounted for in the deepest and simplest fashion. The very room in which I sit, its sensible walls and floor, and the feeling the air and are within it give me, no less than the 'scientific' conceptions which I am urged to frame concerning the mode of existence of all these phenomena when my back is turned, would then all be corroborated, not de-realized, by the ultimate principle of my belief. The World-soul sends me just those phenomena in order that I may react upon them; and among the reactions is the intellectual one of spinning these conceptions. What is beyond the crude experiences is not an alternative to them, but something that means them for me here and now. It is safe to say that, if ever such a system is satisfactorily excogitated, mankind will drop all other systems and cling to that one alone as reel. Meanwhile the other systems coexist with the attempts at that one, and, all being alike fragmentary, each has its little audience and day.\nI have now, I trust, shown sufficiently what the psyche-logic sources of the sense of reality are. Certain postulatesare given in our nature; and whatever satisfies those postulates is treated as if real.  I might therefore finish the it not that a few additional words will chapter here, were it not that a reset the truth in a still clearer light.\nDOUBT.\nThere is hardly a common man who (if consulted) would not say that things come to us in the first instance as ideas; and that if we take them for realities, it is because we add something to them, namely, the predicate of having also 'real existence outside of our thought.' This notion that a higher faculty than the mere having of a conscious content is needed to make us know anything real by its means has pervaded psychology from the earliest times, and is the tradition of Scholasticism, Kantism, and Common-sense. Just as sensations must come as inward affections and then be 'extradited;' as objects of memory must appear at first as presently unrealities, and subsequently be 'projected' backwards as past realities; so conceptions must be entia rationis till a higher faculty uses them as windows to look beyond the ego, into the real extra-mental world; -- so runs the orthodox and popular account.\nAnd there is no question that this is a true account of the way in which many of our later beliefs come to pass. The logical distinction between the bare thought of an object and belief in the object's reality is often a chronological distinction as well. The having and the crediting of and idea do not always coalesce; for often we first suppose and then believe; first play with the notion, frame the hypothesis, and then affirm the existence, of an object of thought. And we are quite conscious of the succession of the two mental acts. But these cases are none of them primitive cases. They only occur in minds long schooled to doubt by the contradictions of experience. The primitive impulse is to affirm immediately the reality of all that is conceived.  When we do doubt, however, in what does the subsequent resolution of the doubt consist? It either consists in a purely verbal performance, the coupling of the adjectives 'real' or 'outwardly existing' (as predicates) to the thing originally conceived (as subject); or it consists in the perception in the given case of that for which these adjectives, abstracted from other similar concrete cases, stand. But what these adjectives stand for, we now know well. They stand for certain relations (immediate, or through intermediaries) to ourselves. Whatever concrete objects have hitherto stood in those relations have been for us 'real,' ' outwardly existing.' So that when we now abstractly admit a thing to be 'real' (without perhaps going through any definite percep- tion of its relations), it is as if we said \"it belongs in the same world with those other objects.\" Naturally enough, we have hourly opportunities for this summary process of belief. All remote objects in space or time are believed in this way. When I believe that some prehistoric savage chipped this flint, for example, the reality of the savage and of his act makes no direct appeal either to my sensation, emotion, or volition. What I mean by my belief in it is, imply my dim sense of a continuity between the long dead savage and his doings and the present world of which the hint forms part. It is preeminently a case for applying our doctrine of the 'fringe ' (see Vol. I. p. 258). When I think the savage with one fringe of relationship, I believe in him; when I think him without that fringe, or with another one (e.g., if I should class him with 'scientific vagaries' in general), I disbelieve him. The word 'real' itself is, in short, a fringe.\nRELATIONS OF BELIEF AND WILL.\nWe shall see in Chapter XXV that will consists in nothing but a manner of attending to certain objects, or consenting to their stable presence before the mind. The objects, in the case of will, are those whose existence depends on our thought, movements of our own body for example, or facts which such movements executed in future may make real. Objects of belief, on the contrary, are those which do not change according as we think regarding them. I want to get up early tomorrow morning; I believe that I got up late yesterday morning; I will that my foreign bookseller in Boston shall procure me a German book and write to him to that effect. I believe that he will make me pay three dollars for it when it comes, etc. Now the important thing to notice is that this difference between the objects of will and belief is entirely immaterial, as far as the relation of the mind to them goes. All that the mind does is in both cases the same; it looks at the object and consents to its existence, espouses it, says 'it shall be my reality.' It turns to it, in short, in the interested active emotional way. The rest is done by nature, which in some cases makes the objects real which we think of in this manner, and in other cases does not. Nature cannot change the past to suit our thinking. She cannot change the stars or the winds; but she does change our bodies to suit our thinking, and through their instrumentality changes much besides; so the great practical distinction between objects which we may will or unwill, and objects which we can merely believe or disbelieve, grows up, and is of course one of the most important distinctions in the world. Its roots, however, do not lie in psychology, but in physiology; as the chapter on Volition will abundantly make plain. Will and belief, in short, meaning a certain relation between objects and the Self, are two names for one and the same PSYCHOLOGICAL phenomenon. All the questions which arise concerning one are questions which arise concerning the other. The causes and conditions of the peculiar relation must be the same in both. The free-will question arises as regards belief. If our wills are indeterminate, so must our beliefs be, etc. The first act of free-will, in short, would naturally be to believe in free-will, etc. In Chapter XXVI, I shall mention this again.\nA practical observation may end this chapter. If belief consists in an emotional reaction of the entire man on an object, how can we believe at will? We cannot control our emotions. Truly enough, a man cannot believe at will abruptly. Nature sometimes, and indeed not very infrequently, produces instantaneous conversions for us. She suddenly puts us in an active connection with objects of which she had till then left us cold. \" I realize for the first time,\" we then say, \"what that means!\" This happens often with moral propositions. We have often heard them; but now they shoot into our lives; they move us; we feel their living force. Such instantaneous beliefs are truly enough not to be achieved by will. But gradually our will can lead us to same results by I very simple method: we need only in cold blood ACT as if the thing in question were real, and keep acting as if it were real, and it infallibly end by growing into such a connection with our life that it will become real. It will become so knit with habit and emotion that our interests in it will be those which characterize belief. \nThose to whom God' and 'Duty' are now mere names can make them much more than that, if they make a little sacrifice to them every day. But all this is so well known in moral and religious education that I need say no more. \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Reprinted, with additions, from 'Mind' for July\n Compare this psychological fact with the corresponding logical truth that all negation rests on covert assertion of something else than the thing denied. (See Bradley's Principles of Logic, bk. r. ch. 3.)\n See that very remarkable little work, 'The Anæthetic Revelation and the Gist of Philosophy,' by Benj. P. Blood (Amsterdam, N.Y., 1874).Compare also Mind, vii. 206.\n To one whose mind is healthy thoughts come and go unnoticed; with me they have to be faced, thought about in a peculiar fashion, and then disposed of as finished, and this often when I am utterly wearied and would be at peace; but the call is imperative. This goes on to the hindrance of all natural action. If I were told that the staircase was on fire,,d I had only a minute to escape, and the thought arose -- ' Have they sent for fire-engines? Is it probable that the man who has the key is off hand? Is the man a careful sort of person? Will the key be hanging on a peg? Am I thinking rightly? Perhaps they don't lock the depot' -- my foot would be lifted to go down; I should be conscious to excitement that I was losing my chance; but I should be unable to stir until all these absurdities were entertained and disposed of. In the most critical moments of my life, when I ought to have been so engrossed as to leave no room for any secondary thoughts, I have been oppressed by the inability to be at peace, and in the most ordinary circumstances it is all the same. Let me instance the other morning I went to walk. The day was biting cold, but1 was unable to proceed except by jerks. Once I got arrested, my feet in a muddy pool. One foot was lifted to go, knowing that it was not good to be standing in water, but there I was fast, the cause of detention being the discussing with myself the reasons why I should not stand in that pool.''

But this physiological accident is logically immaterial to the argument in the text, which ought to apply as well to the dimmest sort of mental image as to the brightest sensation.\n Classics editors note: James' Insertion\n Classics editors note: James' Insertion\n Classics editors note: James' Insertion\n In both existential and attributive judgments a synthesis is represented. The syllable ex in the word Existence, da in the word Dasein, express it. 'The candle exists' is equivalent to 'The candle is over there.' and the 'over there' means real space, space related to other reals. The proposition amounts to saying: 'The candle is in the same space with other reals.' It affirms of the candle a very concrete predicate -- namely, this relation to other particular concrete things. Their real existence, as we shall later see, resolves itself into their peculiar relation to ourselves. Existence is thus no substantive quality when we predicate it of any object; it is a relation, ultimately terminating in ourselves, and tit the moment when it terminates, becoming a practical relation. But of this more anon. I only wish now to indicate the superficial nature of the distinction between the existential and the attributive proposition.\n I define the scientific universe here in the radical mechanical way. Practically, it is oftener thought of in a mongrel way and resembles in more points the popular physical world.\n It thus comes about that we can say such things as that Ivanhoe did not really marry Rebecca, as Thackeray falsely makes him do. In that world does not marry Rebecca. The objects within that world are knit together by perfectly definite relations, which can be affirmed or denied. Whilst absorbed in the novel, we turn our backs on all other worlds, and, for the time, the Ivanhoe-world remains our absolute reality. When we wake from the spell, however, we find a still more real world, which reduces Ivanhoe, and all things connected with him, to the fictive status, and relegates them to one of the sub-universes grouped under No. 5.\n The world of dreams is our real world whilst we are sleeping, because our attention then lapses from the sensible world. Conversely, when we wake the attention usually lapses from the dream-world and that becomes unreal. But if a dream haunts us and compels our attention during the day it is very apt to remain figuring in our consciousness as a sort of sub-universe alongside of the waking world. Most people have probably had dreams which it is hard to imagine not to have been glimpses into an actually existing region of being, perhaps a corner of the 'spiritual world. 'And dreams have accordingly in all ages been regarded as revelations, and have played a large part in furnishing forth mythologies and creating themes for faith to lay hold upon. The 'larger universe,' here, which helps us to believe both in the dream and in the waking reality which is its immediate reductive, is the total universe, of Nature plus the Super-natural. The dream holds true, namely, in one half of that universe ; the waking perceptions in the other half. Even to-day dream-objects figure among the realities in which some ' psychic-researchers' are seeking to rouse our belief. All our theories, not only those about the supernatural, but our philosophic and scientific theories as well, are like our dreams in rousing such different degrees of belief in different minds.\n Distinguishes realities from unrealities. the essential from the rubbishy and neglectable.\n Inquiry concerning Hum.

Hume also: \" When, after the simple conception of anything, we would conceive it as existent, we in reality make no addition to, or alteration of, our first idea. Thus, when we affirm that God is existent, we simply form the idea of such a being as He is represented to us; nor is the existence which we attribute to Him conceived by a particular idea, which we join to His other qualities, and can again separate and distinguish from them.... The belief of the existence joins no new idea to those which compose the ideas of the object. When I think of God, when I think of Him as existent, and when I believe Him to be existent, my idea of Him neither increases nor diminishes. But as 'tis certain there is a great difference betwixt the simple conception of the existence of an object and the belief of it, and as this difference lies not in the facts or compositions of the idea which we conceive. it follows that it most lie in the manner in which we conceive it.\" (Treatise of Human Nature. pt. iii. sec. 7.)\n I use the notion of the Ego here, as common-sense uses it. Nothing is prejudged as to the results (or absence of results) of ulterior attempts to analyze the notion.\n Griesinger, Mental Diseases, §§ 50, 98. The neologism we so often hear, that an experience 'gives us a realizing sense' of the truth of some proposition or other, illustrates the dependence of the sense of reality upon excitement. Only what stirs us is 'realized.'\nThe way in which sensations are pitted against systematized conceptions, and in which the one or the other then prevails according as the sensations are felt by ourselves or merely known by report, is interestingly illustrated at the present day by the state of public belief about 'spiritualistic' phenomena. There exist numerous narratives of movement without contact on the part of articles of furniture and other material objects, in the presence of certain privileged individuals called mediums. Such movement violates our memories, and the whole system of accepted physical 'science.' Consequently those-who have not seen it either brand the narratives immediately as lies or call the phenomena' illusions' of sense, produced by fraud or due to hallucination. But one who has actually seen such a phenomenon, under what seems to him sufficiently 'test-conditions,' will hold to his sensible experience through thick and thin, even though the whole fabric of 'science' should be rent in twain. That man would be a weak-spirited creature indeed who should allow any-blown generalities about 'the liability of the senses to be deceived' to bully him out of his adhesion to what for him was an indubitable experience of sight. a man may err in this obstinacy, sure enough, in any particular case. But the spirit that animates him is that on which ultimately the very life and health of Science rest.\n Treatise of Human Nature, bk. I. pt.

In another place: \" He that sees a candle burning and hath experimented the force of its flame by putting his finger into it, will little doubt that this is something existing without him, which does him harm and puts him to great pain.... And if our dreamer pleases to try whether the glowing heat of a glass furnace be barely a wandering imagination in a drowsy man's fancy by putting his hand into it, he may. perhaps, be awakened into a certainty greater than he could wish, that it is something more than bare imagination. So that the evidence is as great as we can desire, being as certain to us as our pleasure or pain, i.e. happiness or misery; beyond which we have no concernment, either of knowledge or being. Such an assurance of the existence of things without us is sufficient to direct us in the attaining the good and avoiding the evil which is caused by them, which is the important concernment we have of being made acquainted with them.\" (Ibid. bk. iv. chap. 11, § 8.)\n Bagehot, 'The Emotion of Conviction,' Literary Studies, I. 412-17.\n Psychologie Rationnelle, ch. 12.\n Two examples out of a thousand:\nReid, Inquiry, ch. ii § 9: \"I remember, many years ago, a white ox was brought into the country, of so enormous size that people came many miles to see him. There happened, some months after, an uncommon fatality among women in child-bearing.

M. Stanley, Through the Dark Continent, ii. 388: \"On the third day of our stay at Mowa feeling quite comfortable amongst the people, on account of their friendly bearing, I began to write in my note-book the terms for articles, in order to improve my already copious vocabulary of native words. I had proceeded only a few minutes when I observed a strange commotion amongst the people who had been flocking about me, and presently they ran sway. In a short time we heard war-cries ringing loudly and shrilly over the table-land. Two hours afterwards a long line of warriors were seen descending the table-land and advancing towards our camp. There may have been between five and six hundred of them. We, on the other hand, had made but few preparations except such as would justify us replying to them in the event of the actual commencement of hostilities. But I had made many firm friends among them and I hardly believed that I should be able to avert an open rupture. When they had assembled at about a hundred yards in front of our camp, Safeni and I walked up towards them and sat down midway. Some half-dozen of the Yowa people came near, and the shauri began.,'\n\" 'What is the matter, my friends?' I asked. 'Why do you come with guns in your hands, in such numbers, as though you were coming to fight? Fight? fight us, your friends! Tut! I this is some great mistake, surely.'\nMundelé' replied one of them.... 'our people saw you yesterday make marks on some tara-tara  . This is very bad. Our country will waste, our goats will die, our bananas will rot, and our women will dry up. What have we done to you that you should wish to kill us? We have sold you food and we have brought you wine each day. Your people are allowed to wander where they please without trouble. Why is the Mundelé so wicked! We have gathered together to fight you if you do not burn that tara-tara now before our eyes. If you burn it we go away, and shall be your friends as heretofore.'\n''I told them to rest there, and left Safeni in their hands as a pledge that I should return. My tent was not fifty yards from the spot, but while going towards it my brain was busy in devising some plan to foil this superstitious madness. My note-book contained a vast number of valuable notes.... I could not sacrifice it to the childish caprice of savages.9s I was rummaging my book-box, I came across a volume of Shakespeare   much worn and well thumbed, and which was of the same size as my field-book; its cover was similar also, and it might be passed for the field-book, provided that no one remembered its appearance too well. I took it to them. 'Is this the tara-tara, friends, that you wish burned?'\nYes, yes, that is it.'\nWell, take it, and burn it. or keep it.'\n\"M-m. No, no, no. We will not touch it. It is fetish. You must burn it.'\n\" 'I! Well, let it be so. I will do anything to please my good friends of Mowa.'\n\"We walked to the nearest fire. I breathed a regretful farewell to my genial companion, which. during my many weary hours of night, had assisted to relieve my mind when oppressed by almost intolerable woes, and then gravely consigned the innocent Shakespeare to the flames, heaping the brush fuel over it with ceremonious care.\n''Ah-h,' breathed the poor deluded natives sighing their relief....'There is no trouble now.'... End something approaching to a cheer was shouted among them, which terminated the episode of the burning of Shakespeare.\n 'Rationality, Activity, and Faith' (Princeton Review, July 1883, pp 64-9).\n J. Royce, The Religious Aspect of Philosophy (Boston, 1885). pp. 317-57.\n Chapter XXVII\n Prof. Royce puts this well in discussing idealism and the reality of an 'external world. \" If the history of popular speculation on these topics could be written, how much of cowardice and shuffling would be found in the behavior of the natural mind before the question, 'How dost thou know of an external reality. Instead of simply and plainly answering: 'I mean by the external world in the first place something that I accept know of an external reality or demand, that I posit, postulate actively construct on the basis of sense-data,' the natural man gives us all kinds of vague compromise answers....Where shall these endless turnings and twistings have an end?..... All these lesser motives are appealed to, and the one ultimate motive is neglected. The ultimate motive with the man of every-day life is the will to have an external world. Whatever consciousness contains, reason will persist in spontaneously adding the thought: 'But there shall be something beyond this.'.. The popular assurance of an external world is the fixed determination to make one, now and henceforth.\" (Religious Aspect of philosophy, p. 304 -- the italics are my own.) This immixture of the will appears most flagrantly in the fact that although external matter is doubted commonly enough, minds external to our own are never doubted. We need them too much, are too essentially social to dispense with them. Semblances of matter may suffice to react upon, but not semblances of communing souls. a psychic solipsism is too hideous a mockery of our wants, and, so far as I know, has never been seriously entertained. -- Chapters ix and x of Prof. Royce's work are on the whole the dearest account of the psychology of belief with which I am acquainted.\n ''The leading fact in Belief, according to my view of it, is our Primitive Credulity. We begin by believing everything; whatever is, is true.... The animal born in the morning of a summer day proceeds upon the fact of daylight; assumes the perpetuity of that fact. Whatever it is disposed to do. it does without misgivings. If in the morning it began around of operations continuing for hours, under the full benefit of day-light, it would unhesitatingly begin the same roll and in the evening. Its state of mind is practically one of unbounded confidence; but, as yet, it does not understand what confidence means.\n\"The pristine assurance is soon met by checks; a disagreeable experience leading to new insight. To be thwarted and opposed is one of our earliest and most frequent pains. It develops the sense of a distinction between free and obstructed impulses; the unconsciousness of an open way is exchanged for consciousness; we are now said properly to believe in what has never been contradicted, as we disbelieve in what has been contradicted. We believe that, after the dawn of day, there is before us a continuance of light; we do not believe that this light is to continue forever.\n\" Thus, the vital circumstance in belief is never to be contradicted -- never to lose prestige. The number of repetitions counts for little in the process: we are as much convinced after ten as after fifty; we are more convinced by ten unbroken than by fifty for and one against.\" (Bain : The Emotions and the Will, pp. 511, 512.)\n Literature.

J Pikler: The Psychology of the Belief in Objective Existence(London, 1890). -- Mill says that we believe present sensations; and makes our belief in all other things a matter of association with these. So far so good; but as he makes no mention of emotional or volitional reaction, Bain rightly charges him with treating belief as a purely intellectual state. For Bain belief is rather an incident of our active life. When a thing is such, to make us act on it, then we believe it, according to Bain. \"But how about past things, or remote things, upon which no reaction of ours is possible? And how about belief in things which check action\" says Sully; who considers that we believe s thing only when \" the idea of it has an inherent tendency to approximate in character and intensity to a sensation.\" It is obvious that each of these authors emphasizes a true aspect of the question. My own account has sought to be more complete, sensation, association, and active reaction all being acknowledged to be concerned. The most compendious possible formula perhaps would be that out belief and attention are the same fact. For the moment, what we attend to is reality; Attention is a motor reaction; and we are so made that sensations force attention from us. On Belief and Conduct see an article by Leslie Stephen, Fortnightly Review, July 1888.\nA set of facts have been recently brought to my attention which I hardly know how to treat, so I say a word about them in this footnote. Refer to a type of experience which has frequently found a place among the 'Yes' answers to the 'Census of Hallucinations,' and which is generally described by those who report it as an 'impression of the presence' of someone near them, although no sense lion either of sight, hearing, or touch is involved From the way in which this experience is spoken of by those who have had it, it would appear to be an extremely definite and positive state of mind, coupled with a belief in the reality of its object quite as strong as any direct sensation ever gives. And yet no sensation seems to be connected with it at all. Sometimes the person whose nearness is thus impressed is a known person, dead or living, sometimes an unknown one. His attitude and situation are often very definitely impressed, and so, sometimes (though not by way of hearing), are words which he wishes to say.\nThe phenomenon would seem to be due to a pure conception becoming saturated with the sort of stinging urgency which ordinarily only sensations bring. But I cannot yet persuade myself that the urgency in Question consists in concomitant emotional and motor impulses. The ' impression' may come quite suddenly and depart quickly; it may carry no emotional suggestions, and wake no motor consequences beyond those involved in attending to it. Altogether, the matter is somewhat paradoxical, and no conclusion can be come to until more definite data are obtained.\nPerhaps the most curious case of the sort which I have received is the following. The subject of the observation, Mr. P., is an exceptionally intelligent witness, though the words of the narrative are his wife's.\n\"Mr. P. has all his life been the occasional subject of rather singular delusions or impressions of various kinds. If I had belief in the existence of latent or embryo faculties, other than the five senses, I should explain them on that ground. Being totally blind, his other perceptions are abnormally keen and developed, and given the existence of a rudimentary sixth sense, it would be only natural that this also should be more acute in him than in others. One of the most interesting of his experiences in this line was the frequent apparition of a corpse some years ago, which may be worth the attention of your Committee on that subject. At the lime Mr. P. had a music-room in Boston on Beacon Street, where he used to do severe and protracted practice with little interruption. Now, all one season it was a very familiar occurrence with him while in the midst of work to feel a cold draft of air suddenly upon his face, with a prickling sensation at the roots of his hair, when he would turn from the piano, and a figure which he knew to be dead would come sliding under the crack of the door from without, flattening itself to squeeze through and rounding out again to the human form. It was of a middle-aged man, and drew itself along the carpet on hands and knees, but with head thrown back till it reached the sofa, upon which it stretched itself. It remained some moments, but vanished s if Mr. P. spoke or made a decided movement. The most singular point in the occurrence was its frequent repetition. Be might expect it on any day between two and four o'clock, and it came always heralded by the same sudden cold shiver, and was invariably the same figure which went through the same movements. He afterwards traced the whole experience to strong tea. He was in the habit of taking cold tea, which always stimulates him, for lunch, and on giving up this practice whenever saw this or any other apparition again. However, even allowing, as is doubtless true, that the event was a delusion of nerves first fatigued by over work and then excited by this stimulant, there is one point which is still wholly inexplicable and highly interesting to me. Mr. P. has no memory whatever of sight, nor conception of it. It is impossible for him to form any idea of what we mean by light or color, consequently he has no cognizance of any object which does not reach his sense of hearing or of touch, though these are so acute as to give a contrary impression some-times to other people. When he becomes aware of the presence of a person or an object, by means which seem mysterious to outsiders, he can always trace it naturally and legitimately to slight echoes, perceptible only to his keen ears, or to differences in atmospheric pressure, perceptible only to his acute nerves of touch; but with the apparition described, for the only time-in his experience, he was aware of presence, size, and appearance, without the use of either of these mediums. The figure never produced the least sound nor came within a number of feet of his person, yet he knew that it was a man, that it moved, and in what direction, even that it wore a full beard, which, like the thick curly heir, was partially gray; also that it war, dressed in the style of suit known as 'pepper and salt.' These points were all perfectly distinct and invariable each time. If asked how he perceived them, he will answer he cannot tell, he simply knew it. and so strongly and so distinctly that it is impossible to shake the opinion as to the exact details of the man's appearance. It would seem that in this delusion of the senses he really saw, as he has never done in the actual experiences of life, except in the first two years of childhood.\"\nOn cross-examining Mr. P., I could not make out that there was anything like visual imagination involved, although he was quite unable to describe in just what terms the false perception was carried on. It seemed to be more like an intensely definite conception than anything else, a conception to which the feeling of present reality was attached, but in no such shape as easily to fail under the heads laid down in my text."

Nature's noblest gift\u2014my grey goose-quill!\nSlave of my thoughts, obedient to my will,\nTorn from thy parent bird to form a pen,\nThat mighty instrument of little men!\nThe pen! foredoomed to aid the mental throes\nOf brains that labour, big with Verse or Prose;\nThough Nymphs forsake, and Critics may deride,\nThe Lover's solace, and the Author's pride.\nWhat Wits! what Poets dost thou daily raise!\nHow frequent is thy use, how small thy praise!\nCondemned at length to be forgotten quite,\nWith all the pages which 'twas thine to write.\nBut thou, at least, mine own especial pen! \nOnce laid aside, but now assumed again,\nOur task complete, like Hamet's  shall be free;\nThough spurned by others, yet beloved by me:\nThen let us soar to-day; no common theme,\nNo Eastern vision, no distempered dream \nInspires\u2014our path, though full of thorns, is plain;\nSmooth be the verse, and easy be the strain.\nWhen Vice triumphant holds her sov'reign sway,\nObey'd by all who nought beside obey; \nWhen Folly, frequent harbinger of crime,\nBedecks her cap with bells of every Clime; \nWhen knaves and fools combined o'er all prevail,\nAnd weigh their Justice in a Golden Scale; \nE'en then the boldest start from public sneers,\nAfraid of Shame, unknown to other fears,\nMore darkly sin, by Satire kept in awe,\nAnd shrink from Ridicule, though not from Law.\nSuch is the force of Wit! I but not belong\nTo me the arrows of satiric song;\nThe royal vices of our age demand\nA keener weapon, and a mightier hand. \nStill there are follies, e'en for me to chase,\nAnd yield at least amusement in the race:\nLaugh when I laugh, I seek no other fame,\nThe cry is up, and scribblers are my game:\nSpeed, Pegasus!\u2014ye strains of great and small,\nOde! Epic! Elegy!\u2014have at you all!\nI, too, can scrawl, and once upon a time\nI poured along the town a flood of rhyme,\nA schoolboy freak, unworthy praise or blame;\nI printed\u2014older children do the same.\n'Tis pleasant, sure, to see one's name in print;\nA Book's a Book, altho' there's nothing in't.\nNot that a Title's sounding charm can save \nOr scrawl or scribbler from an equal grave:\nThis LAMB  must own, since his patrician name\nFailed to preserve the spurious Farce from shame. \nNo matter, GEORGE continues still to write, \nTho' now the name is veiled from public sight.\nMoved by the great example, I pursue\nThe self-same road, but make my own review:\nNot seek great JEFFREY'S, yet like him will be\nSelf-constituted Judge of Poesy.\nA man must serve his time to every trade\nSave Censure\u2014Critics all are ready made.\nTake hackneyed jokes from MILLER,  got by rote,\nWith just enough of learning to misquote;\nA man well skilled to find, or forge a fault;\nA turn for punning\u2014call it Attic salt;\nTo JEFFREY go, be silent and discreet,\nHis pay is just ten sterling pounds per sheet:\nFear not to lie,'twill seem a sharper hit; \nShrink not from blasphemy, 'twill pass for wit;\nCare not for feeling\u2014pass your proper jest,\nAnd stand a Critic, hated yet caress'd.\nAnd shall we own such judgment? no\u2014as soon\nSeek roses in December\u2014ice in June;\nHope constancy in wind, or corn in chaff,\nBelieve a woman or an epitaph,\nOr any other thing that's false, before\nYou trust in Critics, who themselves are sore;\nOr yield one single thought to be misled\nBy JEFFREY'S heart, or LAMB'S Boeotian head. \nTo these young tyrants, by themselves misplaced,\nCombined usurpers on the Throne of Taste;\nTo these, when Authors bend in humble awe,\nAnd hail their voice as Truth, their word as Law;\nWhile these are Censors, 'twould be sin to spare; \nWhile such are Critics, why should I forbear?\nBut yet, so near all modern worthies run,\n'Tis doubtful whom to seek, or whom to shun;\nNor know we when to spare, or where to strike,\nOur Bards and Censors are so much alike.\nThen should you ask me,  why I venture o'er\nThe path which POPE and GIFFORD  trod before;\nIf not yet sickened, you can still proceed;\nGo on; my rhyme will tell you as you read.\n\"But hold!\" exclaims a friend,\u2014\"here's some neglect:\nThis\u2014that\u2014and t'other line seem incorrect.\"\nWhat then? the self-same blunder Pope has got,\nAnd careless Dryden\u2014\"Aye, but Pye has not:\"\u2014\nIndeed!\u2014'tis granted, faith!\u2014but what care I?\nBetter to err with POPE, than shine with PYE. \nTime was, ere yet in these degenerate days \nIgnoble themes obtained mistaken praise,\nWhen Sense and Wit with Poesy allied,\nNo fabled Graces, flourished side by side,\nFrom the same fount their inspiration drew,\nAnd, reared by Taste, bloomed fairer as they grew.\nThen, in this happy Isle, a POPE'S pure strain\nSought the rapt soul to charm, nor sought in vain;\nA polished nation's praise aspired to claim,\nAnd raised the people's, as the poet's fame.\nLike him great DRYDEN poured the tide of song,\nIn stream less smooth, indeed, yet doubly strong.\nThen CONGREVE'S scenes could cheer, or OTWAY'S melt; \nFor Nature then an English audience felt\u2014\nBut why these names, or greater still, retrace,\nWhen all to feebler Bards resign their place?\nYet to such times our lingering looks are cast,\nWhen taste and reason with those times are past.\nNow look around, and turn each trifling page,\nSurvey the precious works that please the age;\nThis truth at least let Satire's self allow,\nNo dearth of Bards can be complained of now. \nThe loaded Press beneath her labour groans, \nAnd Printers' devils shake their weary bones;\nWhile SOUTHEY'S Epics cram the creaking shelves, \nAnd LITTLE'S Lyrics shine in hot-pressed twelves. \nThus saith the Preacher: \"Nought beneath the sun\nIs new,\"  yet still from change to change we run.\nWhat varied wonders tempt us as they pass!\nThe Cow-pox, Tractors, Galvanism, and Gas, \nIn turns appear, to make the vulgar stare,\nTill the swoln bubble bursts\u2014and all is air!\nNor less new schools of Poetry arise,\nWhere dull pretenders grapple for the prize:\nO'er Taste awhile these Pseudo-bards prevail; \nEach country Book-club bows the knee to Baal,\nAnd, hurling lawful Genius from the throne,\nErects a shrine and idol of its own; \nSome leaden calf\u2014but whom it matters not,\nFrom soaring SOUTHEY, down to groveling STOTT. \nBehold! in various throngs the scribbling crew,\nFor notice eager, pass in long review:\nEach spurs his jaded Pegasus apace,\nAnd Rhyme and Blank maintain an equal race;\nSonnets on sonnets crowd, and ode on ode;\nAnd Tales of Terror  jostle on the road;\nImmeasurable measures move along;\nFor simpering Folly loves a varied song,\nTo strange, mysterious Dulness still the friend,\nAdmires the strain she cannot comprehend.\nThus Lays of Minstrels \u2014may they be the last!\u2014\nOn half-strung harps whine mournful to the blast.\nWhile mountain spirits prate to river sprites,\nThat dames may listen to the sound at nights;\nAnd goblin brats, of Gilpin Horner's  brood\nDecoy young Border-nobles through the wood,\nAnd skip at every step, Lord knows how high,\nAnd frighten foolish babes, the Lord knows why;\nWhile high-born ladies in their magic cell,\nForbidding Knights to read who cannot spell,\nDespatch a courier to a wizard's grave,\nAnd fight with honest men to shield a knave.\nNext view in state, proud prancing on his roan,\nThe golden-crested haughty Marmion,\nNow forging scrolls, now foremost in the fight,\nNot quite a Felon, yet but half a Knight. \nThe gibbet or the field prepared to grace;\nA mighty mixture of the great and base.\nAnd think'st thou, SCOTT! by vain conceit perchance,\nOn public taste to foist thy stale romance,\nThough MURRAY with his MILLER may combine\nTo yield thy muse just half-a-crown per line? \nNo! when the sons of song descend to trade,\nTheir bays are sear, their former laurels fade,\nLet such forego the poet's sacred name,\nWho rack their brains for lucre, not for fame:\nStill for stern Mammon may they toil in vain! \nAnd sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain! 180\nSuch be their meed, such still the just reward \nOf prostituted Muse and hireling bard!\nFor this we spurn Apollo's venal son,\nAnd bid a long \"good night to Marmion.\" \nThese are the themes that claim our plaudits now;\nThese are the Bards to whom the Muse must bow;\nWhile MILTON, DRYDEN, POPE, alike forgot,\nResign their hallowed Bays to WALTER SCOTT.\nThe time has been, when yet the Muse was young,\nWhen HOMER swept the lyre, and MARO sung,\nAn Epic scarce ten centuries could claim,\nWhile awe-struck nations hailed the magic name:\nThe work of each immortal Bard appears\nThe single wonder of a thousand years. \nEmpires have mouldered from the face of earth,\nTongues have expired with those who gave them birth,\nWithout the glory such a strain can give,\nAs even in ruin bids the language live.\nNot so with us, though minor Bards, content, \nOn one great work a life of labour spent:\nWith eagle pinion soaring to the skies,\nBehold the Ballad-monger SOUTHEY rise!\nTo him let CAMOËNS, MILTON, TASSO yield,\nWhose annual strains, like armies, take the field.\nFirst in the ranks see Joan of Arc advance,\nThe scourge of England and the boast of France!\nThough burnt by wicked BEDFORD for a witch,\nBehold her statue placed in Glory's niche;\nHer fetters burst, and just released from prison,\nA virgin Phoenix from her ashes risen.\nNext see tremendous Thalaba come on, \nArabia's monstrous, wild, and wond'rous son;\nDomdaniel's dread destroyer, who o'erthrew\nMore mad magicians than the world e'er knew.\nImmortal Hero! all thy foes o'ercome,\nFor ever reign\u2014the rival of Tom Thumb! \nSince startled Metre fled before thy face,\nWell wert thou doomed the last of all thy race!\nWell might triumphant Genii bear thee hence,\nIllustrious conqueror of common sense!\nNow, last and greatest, Madoc spreads his sails,\nCacique in Mexico,  and Prince in Wales;\nTells us strange tales, as other travellers do,\nMore old than Mandeville's, and not so true.\nOh, SOUTHEY! SOUTHEY!  cease thy varied song!\nA bard may chaunt too often and too long:\nAs thou art strong in verse, in mercy, spare!\nA fourth, alas! were more than we could bear.\nBut if, in spite of all the world can say,\nThou still wilt verseward plod thy weary way;\nIf still in Berkeley-Ballads most uncivil,\nThou wilt devote old women to the devil, \nThe babe unborn thy dread intent may rue:\n\"God help thee,\" SOUTHEY,  and thy readers too.\nNext comes the dull disciple of thy school, \nThat mild apostate from poetic rule,\nThe simple WORDSWORTH, framer of a lay\nAs soft as evening in his favourite May,\nWho warns his friend \"to shake off toil and trouble,\nAnd quit his books, for fear of growing double;\" \nWho, both by precept and example, shows\nThat prose is verse, and verse is merely prose;\nConvincing all, by demonstration plain,\nPoetic souls delight in prose insane;\nAnd Christmas stories tortured into rhyme\nContain the essence of the true sublime.\nThus, when he tells the tale of Betty Foy,\nThe idiot mother of \"an idiot Boy;\"\nA moon-struck, silly lad, who lost his way,\nAnd, like his bard, confounded night with day \nSo close on each pathetic part he dwells,\nAnd each adventure so sublimely tells,\nThat all who view the \"idiot in his glory\"\nConceive the Bard the hero of the story.\nShall gentle COLERIDGE pass unnoticed here, \nTo turgid ode and tumid stanza dear?\nThough themes of innocence amuse him best,\nYet still Obscurity's a welcome guest.\nIf Inspiration should her aid refuse\nTo him who takes a Pixy for a muse, \nYet none in lofty numbers can surpass\nThe bard who soars to elegize an ass:\nSo well the subject suits his noble mind, \nHe brays, the Laureate of the long-eared kind. \nOh! wonder-working LEWIS!  Monk, or Bard,\nWho fain would make Parnassus a church-yard! \nLo! wreaths of yew, not laurel, bind thy brow,\nThy Muse a Sprite, Apollo's sexton thou!\nWhether on ancient tombs thou tak'st thy stand,\nBy gibb'ring spectres hailed, thy kindred band;\nOr tracest chaste descriptions on thy page,\nTo please the females of our modest age;\nAll hail, M.P.!  from whose infernal brain\nThin-sheeted phantoms glide, a grisly train;\nAt whose command \"grim women\" throng in crowds,\nAnd kings of fire, of water, and of clouds,\nWith \"small grey men,\"\u2014\"wild yagers,\" and what not,\nTo crown with honour thee and WALTER SCOTT:\nAgain, all hail! if tales like thine may please,\nSt. Luke alone can vanquish the disease:\nEven Satan's self with thee might dread to dwell,\nAnd in thy skull discern a deeper Hell.\nWho in soft guise, surrounded by a choir\nOf virgins melting, not to Vesta's fire,\nWith sparkling eyes, and cheek by passion flushed\nStrikes his wild lyre, whilst listening dames are hushed?\n'Tis LITTLE! young Catullus of his day,\nAs sweet, but as immoral, in his Lay!\nGrieved to condemn, the Muse must still be just,\nNor spare melodious advocates of lust.\nPure is the flame which o'er her altar burns;\nFrom grosser incense with disgust she turns\nYet kind to youth, this expiation o'er,\nShe bids thee \"mend thy line, and sin no more.\" \nFor thee, translator of the tinsel song,\nTo whom such glittering ornaments belong,\nHibernian STRANGFORD! with thine eyes of blue, \nAnd boasted locks of red or auburn hue,\nWhose plaintive strain each love-sick Miss admires,\nAnd o'er harmonious fustian half expires, \nLearn, if thou canst, to yield thine author's sense,\nNor vend thy sonnets on a false pretence.\nThink'st thou to gain thy verse a higher place,\nBy dressing Camoëns  in a suit of lace?\nMend, STRANGFORD! mend thy morals and thy taste;\nBe warm, but pure; be amorous, but be chaste:\nCease to deceive; thy pilfered harp restore,\nNor teach the Lusian Bard to copy MOORE.\nBehold\u2014Ye Tarts!\u2014one moment spare the text! \u2014\nHAYLEY'S last work, and worst\u2014until his next;\nWhether he spin poor couplets into plays,\nOr damn the dead with purgatorial praise, \nHis style in youth or age is still the same,\nFor ever feeble and for ever tame.\nTriumphant first see \"Temper's Triumphs\" shine!\nAt least I'm sure they triumphed over mine.\nOf \"Music's Triumphs,\" all who read may swear\nThat luckless Music never triumph'd there. \nMoravians, rise! bestow some meet reward \nOn dull devotion\u2014Lo! the Sabbath Bard,\nSepulchral GRAHAME,  pours his notes sublime\nIn mangled prose, nor e'en aspires to rhyme;\nBreaks into blank the Gospel of St. Luke, \nAnd boldly pilfers from the Pentateuch;\nAnd, undisturbed by conscientious qualms,\nPerverts the Prophets, and purloins the Psalms.\nHail, Sympathy! thy soft idea brings\" \nA thousand visions of a thousand things,\nAnd shows, still whimpering thro' threescore of years, \nThe maudlin prince of mournful sonneteers. 330\nAnd art thou not their prince, harmonious Bowles! \nThou first, great oracle of tender souls?\nWhether them sing'st with equal ease, and grief, \nThe fall of empires, or a yellow leaf;\nWhether thy muse most lamentably tells\nWhat merry sounds proceed from Oxford bells, \nOr, still in bells delighting, finds a friend\nIn every chime that jingled from Ostend;\nAh! how much juster were thy Muse's hap,\nIf to thy bells thou would'st but add a cap! \nDelightful BOWLES! still blessing and still blest,\nAll love thy strain, but children like it best.\n'Tis thine, with gentle LITTLE'S moral song,\nTo soothe the mania of the amorous throng!\nWith thee our nursery damsels shed their tears,\nEre Miss as yet completes her infant years:\nBut in her teens thy whining powers are vain;\nShe quits poor BOWLES for LITTLE'S purer strain.\nNow to soft themes thou scornest to confine \nThe lofty numbers of a harp like thine;\n\"Awake a louder and a loftier strain,\" \nSuch as none heard before, or will again!\nWhere all discoveries jumbled from the flood,\nSince first the leaky ark reposed in mud,\nBy more or less, are sung in every book,\nFrom Captain Noah down to Captain Cook.\nNor this alone\u2014but, pausing on the road,\nThe Bard sighs forth a gentle episode,  \nAnd gravely tells\u2014attend, each beauteous Miss!\u2014\nWhen first Madeira trembled to a kiss. 360\nBowles! in thy memory let this precept dwell,\nStick to thy Sonnets, Man!\u2014at least they sell.\nBut if some new-born whim, or larger bribe,\nPrompt thy crude brain, and claim thee for a scribe:\nIf 'chance some bard, though once by dunces feared,\nNow, prone in dust, can only be revered;\nIf Pope, whose fame and genius, from the first, \nHave foiled the best of critics, needs the worst,\nDo thou essay: each fault, each failing scan;\nThe first of poets was, alas! but man.\nRake from each ancient dunghill ev'ry pearl,\nConsult Lord Fanny, and confide in CURLL; \nLet all the scandals of a former age\nPerch on thy pen, and flutter o'er thy page;\nAffect a candour which thou canst not feel,\nClothe envy in a garb of honest zeal;\nWrite, as if St. John's soul could still inspire,\nAnd do from hate what MALLET  did for hire.\nOh! hadst thou lived in that congenial time\nTo rave with DENNIS, and with RALPH to rhyme; \nThronged with the rest around his living head,\nNot raised thy hoof against the lion dead,\nA meet reward had crowned thy glorious gains,\nAnd linked thee to the Dunciad for thy pains. \nAnother Epic! Who inflicts again\nMore books of blank upon the sons of men?\nBoeotian COTTLE, rich Bristowa's boast,\nImports old stories from the Cambrian coast,\nAnd sends his goods to market\u2014all alive!\nLines forty thousand, Cantos twenty-five!\nFresh fish from Hippocrene!  who'll buy? who'll buy?\nThe precious bargain's cheap\u2014in faith, not I.\nYour turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat, \nThough Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat;\nIf Commerce fills the purse, she clogs the brain,\nAnd AMOS COTTLE strikes the Lyre in vain.\nIn him an author's luckless lot behold!\nCondemned to make the books which once he sold.\nOh, AMOS COTTLE!\u2014Phoebus! what a name\nTo fill the speaking-trump of future fame!\u2014\nOh, AMOS COTTLE! for a moment think\nWhat meagre profits spring from pen and ink!\nWhen thus devoted to poetic dreams,\nWho will peruse thy prostituted reams?\nOh! pen perverted! paper misapplied!\nHad COTTLE  still adorned the counter's side,\nBent o'er the desk, or, born to useful toils,\nBeen taught to make the paper which he soils,\nPloughed, delved, or plied the oar with lusty limb,\nHe had not sung of Wales, nor I of him.\nAs Sisyphus against the infernal steep\nRolls the huge rock whose motions ne'er may sleep,\nSo up thy hill, ambrosial Richmond! heaves\nDull MAURICE  all his granite weight of leaves:\nSmooth, solid monuments of mental pain!\nThe petrifactions of a plodding brain,\nThat, ere they reach the top, fall lumbering back again.\nWith broken lyre and cheek serenely pale,\nLo! sad Alcæus wanders down the vale;\nThough fair they rose, and might have bloomed at last,\nHis hopes have perished by the northern blast:\nNipped in the bud by Caledonian gales,\nHis blossoms wither as the blast prevails!\nO'er his lost works let classic SHEFFIELD weep;\nMay no rude hand disturb their early sleep! \nYet say! why should the Bard, at once, resign \nHis claim to favour from the sacred Nine?\nFor ever startled by the mingled howl\nOf Northern Wolves, that still in darkness prowl;\nA coward Brood, which mangle as they prey,\nBy hellish instinct, all that cross their way;\nAged or young, the living or the dead,\" \nNo mercy find-these harpies must be fed.\nWhy do the injured unresisting yield\nThe calm possession of their native field?\nWhy tamely thus before their fangs retreat,\nNor hunt the blood-hounds back to Arthur's Seat? \nHealth to immortal JEFFREY! once, in name,\nEngland could boast a judge almost the same; \nIn soul so like, so merciful, yet just,\nSome think that Satan has resigned his trust,\nAnd given the Spirit to the world again,\nTo sentence Letters, as he sentenced men.\nWith hand less mighty, but with heart as black,\nWith voice as willing to decree the rack;\nBred in the Courts betimes, though all that law\nAs yet hath taught him is to find a flaw,\u2014\nSince well instructed in the patriot school\nTo rail at party, though a party tool\u2014\nWho knows? if chance his patrons should restore\nBack to the sway they forfeited before,\nHis scribbling toils some recompense may meet,\nAnd raise this Daniel to the Judgment-Seat. \nLet JEFFREY'S shade indulge the pious hope,\nAnd greeting thus, present him with a rope:\n\"Heir to my virtues! man of equal mind!\nSkilled to condemn as to traduce mankind,\nThis cord receive! for thee reserved with care,\nTo wield in judgment, and at length to wear.\"\nHealth to great JEFFREY! Heaven preserve his life,\nTo flourish on the fertile shores of Fife,\nAnd guard it sacred in its future wars,\nSince authors sometimes seek the field of Mars!\nCan none remember that eventful day,  \nThat ever-glorious, almost fatal fray,\nWhen LITTLE'S leadless pistol met his eye, \nAnd Bow-street Myrmidons stood laughing by?\nOh, day disastrous! on her firm-set rock,\nDunedin's castle felt a secret shock;\nDark rolled the sympathetic waves of Forth,\nLow groaned the startled whirlwinds of the north;\nTWEED ruffled half his waves to form a tear,\nThe other half pursued his calm career; \nARTHUR'S steep summit nodded to its base,\nThe surly Tolbooth scarcely kept her place.\nThe Tolbooth felt\u2014for marble sometimes can,\nOn such occasions, feel as much as man\u2014\nThe Tolbooth felt defrauded of his charms,\nIf JEFFREY died, except within her arms: \nNay last, not least, on that portentous morn,\nThe sixteenth story, where himself was born,\nHis patrimonial garret, fell to ground,\nAnd pale Edina shuddered at the sound:\nStrewed were the streets around with milk-white reams,\nFlowed all the Canongate with inky streams;\nThis of his candour seemed the sable dew,\nThat of his valour showed the bloodless hue;\nAnd all with justice deemed the two combined\nThe mingled emblems of his mighty mind.\nBut Caledonia's goddess hovered o'er\nThe field, and saved him from the wrath of Moore;\nFrom either pistol snatched the vengeful lead,\nAnd straight restored it to her favourite's head;\nThat head, with greater than magnetic power,\nCaught it, as Danäe caught the golden shower,\nAnd, though the thickening dross will scarce refine,\nAugments its ore, and is itself a mine.\n\"My son,\" she cried, \"ne'er thirst for gore again,\nResign the pistol and resume the pen;\nO'er politics and poesy preside,\nBoast of thy country, and Britannia's guide!\nFor long as Albion's heedless sons submit,\nOr Scottish taste decides on English wit,\nSo long shall last thine unmolested reign,\nNor any dare to take thy name in vain.\nBehold, a chosen band shall aid thy plan,\nAnd own thee chieftain of the critic clan.\nFirst in the oat-fed phalanx  shall be seen\nThe travelled Thane, Athenian Aberdeen. \nHERBERT shall wield THOR'S hammer,  and sometimes\nIn gratitude, thou'lt praise his rugged rhymes.\nSmug SYDNEY  too thy bitter page shall seek,\nAnd classic HALLAM,  much renowned for Greek;\nSCOTT may perchance his name and influence lend,\nAnd paltry PILLANS  shall traduce his friend;\nWhile gay Thalia's luckless votary, LAMB,  \nDamned like the Devil\u2014Devil-like will damn.\nKnown be thy name! unbounded be thy sway!\nThy HOLLAND'S banquets shall each toil repay!\nWhile grateful Britain yields the praise she owes\nTo HOLLAND'S hirelings and to Learning's foes.\nYet mark one caution ere thy next Review\nSpread its light wings of Saffron and of Blue,\nBeware lest blundering BROUGHAM  destroy the sale,\nTurn Beef to Bannocks, Cauliflowers to Kail.\"\nThus having said, the kilted Goddess kist\nHer son, and vanished in a Scottish mist. \nThen prosper, JEFFREY! pertest of the train \nWhom Scotland pampers with her fiery grain!\nWhatever blessing waits a genuine Scot, 530\nIn double portion swells thy glorious lot;\nFor thee Edina culls her evening sweets,\nAnd showers their odours on thy candid sheets,\nWhose Hue and Fragrance to thy work adhere\u2014\nThis scents its pages, and that gilds its rear. \nLo! blushing Itch, coy nymph, enamoured grown,\nForsakes the rest, and cleaves to thee alone,\nAnd, too unjust to other Pictish men,\nEnjoys thy person, and inspires thy pen!\nIllustrious HOLLAND! hard would be his lot,\nHis hirelings mentioned, and himself forgot! \nHOLLAND, with HENRY PETTY  at his back,\nThe whipper-in and huntsman of the pack.\nBlest be the banquets spread at Holland House,\nWhere Scotchmen feed, and Critics may carouse!\nLong, long beneath that hospitable roof \nShall Grub-street dine, while duns are kept aloof.\nSee honest HALLAM  lay aside his fork,\nResume his pen, review his Lordship's work,\nAnd, grateful for the dainties on his plate, \nDeclare his landlord can at least translate! \nDunedin! view thy children with delight,\nThey write for food\u2014and feed because they write: \nAnd lest, when heated with the unusual grape,\nSome glowing thoughts should to the press escape,\nAnd tinge with red the female reader's cheek,\nMy lady skims the cream of each critique;\nBreathes o'er the page her purity of soul,\nReforms each error, and refines the whole. \nNow to the Drama turn\u2014Oh! motley sight!\nWhat precious scenes the wondering eyes invite:\nPuns, and a Prince within a barrel pent,  \nAnd Dibdin's nonsense yield complete content. \nThough now, thank Heaven! the Rosciomania's o'er. \nAnd full-grown actors are endured once more;\nYet what avail their vain attempts to please,\nWhile British critics suffer scenes like these;\nWhile REYNOLDS vents his \"'dammes!'\" \"poohs!\" and\n\"zounds!\"  \nAnd common-place and common sense confounds?\nWhile KENNEY'S  \"World\"\u2014ah! where is KENNEY'S wit? \u2014 570\nTires the sad gallery, lulls the listless Pit;\nAnd BEAUMONT'S pilfered Caratach affords\nA tragedy complete in all but words? \nWho but must mourn, while these are all the rage\nThe degradation of our vaunted stage?\nHeavens! is all sense of shame and talent gone?\nHave we no living Bard of merit?\u2014none?\nAwake, GEORGE COLMAN!  CUMBERLAND, awake!\nRing the alarum bell! let folly quake!\nOh! SHERIDAN! if aught can move thy pen,\nLet Comedy assume her throne again; \nAbjure the mummery of German schools;\nLeave new Pizarros to translating fools; \nGive, as thy last memorial to the age,\nOne classic drama, and reform the stage.\nGods! o'er those boards shall Folly rear her head,\nWhere GARRICK trod, and SIDDONS lives to tread?  \nOn those shall Farce display buffoonery's mask,\nAnd HOOK conceal his heroes in a cask? \nShall sapient managers new scenes produce\nFrom CHERRY,  SKEFFINGTON,  and Mother GOOSE?  \nWhile SHAKESPEARE, OTWAY, MASSINGER, forgot,\nOn stalls must moulder, or in closets rot?\nLo! with what pomp the daily prints proclaim\nThe rival candidates for Attic fame!\nIn grim array though LEWIS' spectres rise,\nStill SKEFFINGTON and GOOSE divide the prize.\nAnd sure 'great' Skeffington must claim our praise,\nFor skirtless coats and skeletons of plays\nRenowned alike; whose genius ne'er confines\nHer flight to garnish Greenwood's gay designs;  \nNor sleeps with \"Sleeping Beauties,\" but anon\nIn five facetious acts comes thundering on.\nWhile poor John Bull, bewildered with the scene,\nStares, wondering what the devil it can mean;\nBut as some hands applaud, a venal few!\nRather than sleep, why John applauds it too.\nSuch are we now. Ah! wherefore should we turn\nTo what our fathers were, unless to mourn?\nDegenerate Britons! are ye dead to shame,\nOr, kind to dulness, do you fear to blame?\nWell may the nobles of our present race\nWatch each distortion of a NALDI'S face;\nWell may they smile on Italy's buffoons,\nAnd worship CATALANI's pantaloons, \nSince their own Drama yields no fairer trace\nOf wit than puns, of humour than grimace. \nThen let Ausonia, skill'd in every art\nTo soften manners, but corrupt the heart,\nPour her exotic follies o'er the town,\nTo sanction Vice, and hunt Decorum down:\nLet wedded strumpets languish o'er DESHAYES,\nAnd bless the promise which his form displays;\nWhile Gayton bounds before th' enraptured looks\nOf hoary Marquises, and stripling Dukes:\nLet high-born lechers eye the lively Presle\nTwirl her light limbs, that spurn the needless veil;\nLet Angiolini bare her breast of snow,\nWave the white arm, and point the pliant toe;\nCollini trill her love-inspiring song,\nStrain her fair neck, and charm the listening throng!\nWhet  not your scythe, Suppressors of our Vice!\nReforming Saints! too delicately nice!\nBy whose decrees, our sinful souls to save,\nNo Sunday tankards foam, no barbers shave;\nAnd beer undrawn, and beards unmown, display\nYour holy reverence for the Sabbath-day.\nOr hail at once the patron and the pile\nOf vice and folly, Greville and Argyle! \nWhere yon proud palace, Fashion's hallow'd fane,\nSpreads wide her portals for the motley train,\nBehold the new Petronius  of the day, \nOur arbiter of pleasure and of play!\nThere the hired eunuch, the Hesperian choir,\nThe melting lute, the soft lascivious lyre,\nThe song from Italy, the step from France,\nThe midnight orgy, and the mazy dance,\nThe smile of beauty, and the flush of wine,\nFor fops, fools, gamesters, knaves, and Lords combine:\nEach to his humour\u2014Comus all allows; 650\nChampaign, dice, music, or your neighbour's spouse.\nTalk not to us, ye starving sons of trade!\nOf piteous ruin, which ourselves have made;\nIn Plenty's sunshine Fortune's minions bask,\nNor think of Poverty, except \"en masque,\" \nWhen for the night some lately titled ass\nAppears the beggar which his grandsire was,\nThe curtain dropped, the gay Burletta o'er,\nThe audience take their turn upon the floor:\nNow round the room the circling dow'gers sweep,\nNow in loose waltz the thin-clad daughters leap;\nThe first in lengthened line majestic swim,\nThe last display the free unfettered limb!\nThose for Hibernia's lusty sons repair\nWith art the charms which Nature could not spare;\nThese after husbands wing their eager flight,\nNor leave much mystery for the nuptial night.\nOh! blest retreats of infamy and ease,\nWhere, all forgotten but the power to please,\nEach maid may give a loose to genial thought,\nEach swain may teach new systems, or be taught:\nThere the blithe youngster, just returned from Spain,\nCuts the light pack, or calls the rattling main;\nThe jovial Caster's set, and seven's the Nick,\nOr\u2014done!\u2014a thousand on the coming trick!\nIf, mad with loss, existence 'gins to tire,\nAnd all your hope or wish is to expire,\nHere's POWELL'S  pistol ready for your life,\nAnd, kinder still, two PAGETS for your wife: \nFit consummation of an earthly race\nBegun in folly, ended in disgrace,\nWhile none but menials o'er the bed of death,\nWash thy red wounds, or watch thy wavering breath;\nTraduced by liars, and forgot by all,\nThe mangled victim of a drunken brawl,\nTo live like CLODIUS,  and like FALKLAND fall.\nTruth! rouse some genuine Bard, and guide his hand\nTo drive this pestilence from out the land.\nE'en I\u2014least thinking of a thoughtless throng,\nJust skilled to know the right and choose the wrong,\nFreed at that age when Reason's shield is lost,\nTo fight my course through Passion's countless host, \nWhom every path of Pleasure's flow'ry way\nHas lured in turn, and all have led astray\u2014\nE'en I must raise my voice, e'en I must feel\nSuch scenes, such men, destroy the public weal:\nAltho' some kind, censorious friend will say,\n\"What art thou better, meddling fool,  than they?\"\nAnd every Brother Rake will smile to see\nThat miracle, a Moralist in me.\nNo matter\u2014when some Bard in virtue strong,\nGifford perchance, shall raise the chastening song,\nThen sleep my pen for ever! and my voice\nBe only heard to hail him, and rejoice,\nRejoice, and yield my feeble praise, though I\nMay feel the lash that Virtue must apply.\nAs for the smaller fry, who swarm in shoals\nFrom silly HAFIZ up to simple BOWLES, \nWhy should we call them from their dark abode,\nIn Broad St. Giles's or Tottenham-Road?\nOr (since some men of fashion nobly dare\nTo scrawl in verse) from Bond-street or the Square? \nIf things of Ton their harmless lays indite,\nMost wisely doomed to shun the public sight,\nWhat harm? in spite of every critic elf,\nSir T. may read his stanzas to himself;\nMILES ANDREWS  still his strength in couplets try,\nAnd live in prologues, though his dramas die.\nLords too are Bards: such things at times befall,\nAnd 'tis some praise in Peers to write at all.\nYet, did or Taste or Reason sway the times,\nAh! who would take their titles with their rhymes? \nROSCOMMON!  SHEFFIELD!  with your spirits fled, \nNo future laurels deck a noble head;\nNo Muse will cheer, with renovating smile,\nThe paralytic puling of CARLISLE.  \nThe puny schoolboy and his early lay\nMen pardon, if his follies pass away;\nBut who forgives the Senior's ceaseless verse\nWhose hairs grow hoary as his rhymes grow worse?\nWhat heterogeneous honours deck the Peer!\nLord, rhymester, petit-maître, pamphleteer! \nSo dull in youth, so drivelling in his age,\nHis scenes alone had damned our sinking stage;\nBut Managers for once cried, \"Hold, enough!\"\nNor drugged their audience with the tragic stuff.\nYet at their judgment let his Lordship laugh, \nAnd case his volumes in congenial calf;\nYes! doff that covering, where Morocco shines,\nAnd hang a calf-skin on those recreant lines. \nWith you, ye Druids! rich in native lead,\nWho daily scribble for your daily bread:\nWith you I war not: GIFFORD'S heavy hand\nHas crushed, without remorse, your numerous band.\nOn \"All the Talents\" vent your venal spleen; \nWant is your plea, let Pity be your screen.\nLet Monodies on Fox regale your crew,\nAnd Melville's Mantle  prove a Blanket too!\nOne common Lethe waits each hapless Bard,\nAnd, peace be with you! 'tis your best reward.\nSuch damning fame; as Dunciads only give \nCould bid your lines beyond a morning live;\nBut now at once your fleeting labours close,\nWith names of greater note in blest repose.\nFar be't from me unkindly to upbraid\nThe lovely ROSA'S prose in masquerade,\nWhose strains, the faithful echoes of her mind,\nLeave wondering comprehension far behind. \nThough Crusca's bards no more our journals fill, \nSome stragglers skirmish round the columns still;\nLast of the howling host which once was Bell's, \nMatilda snivels yet, and Hafiz yells;\nAnd Merry's  metaphors appear anew,\nChained to the signature of O. P. Q. \nWhen some brisk youth, the tenant of a stall,\nEmploys a pen less pointed than his awl,\nLeaves his snug shop, forsakes his store of shoes,\nSt. Crispin quits, and cobbles for the Muse,\nHeavens! how the vulgar stare! how crowds applaud!\nHow ladies read, and Literati laud! \nIf chance some wicked wag should pass his jest,\n'Tis sheer ill-nature\u2014don't the world know best?\nGenius must guide when wits admire the rhyme,\nAnd CAPEL LOFFT  declares 'tis quite sublime.\nHear, then, ye happy sons of needless trade!\nSwains! quit the plough, resign the useless spade!\nLo! BURNS and BLOOMFIELD, nay, a greater far,\nGIFFORD was born beneath an adverse star,\nForsook the labours of a servile state,\nStemmed the rude storm, and triumphed over Fate:\nThen why no more? if Phoebus smiled on you,\nBLOOMFIELD! why not on brother Nathan too? \nHim too the Mania, not the Muse, has seized;\nNot inspiration, but a mind diseased:\nAnd now no Boor can seek his last abode,\nNo common be inclosed without an ode.\nOh! since increased refinement deigns to smile\nOn Britain's sons, and bless our genial Isle,\nLet Poesy go forth, pervade the whole,\nAlike the rustic, and mechanic soul!\nYe tuneful cobblers! still your notes prolong,\nCompose at once a slipper and a song;\nSo shall the fair your handywork peruse,\nYour sonnets sure shall please\u2014perhaps your shoes.\nMay Moorland weavers  boast Pindaric skill,\nAnd tailors' lays be longer than their bill!\nWhile punctual beaux reward the grateful notes,\nAnd pay for poems\u2014when they pay for coats.\nTo the famed throng now paid the tribute due, \nNeglected Genius! let me turn to you.\nCome forth, oh CAMPBELL! give thy talents scope;\nWho dares aspire if thou must cease to hope?\nAnd thou, melodious ROGERS! rise at last,\nRecall the pleasing memory of the past; \nArise! let blest remembrance still inspire,\nAnd strike to wonted tones thy hallowed lyre;\nRestore Apollo to his vacant throne,\nAssert thy country's honour and thine own.\nWhat! must deserted Poesy still weep\nWhere her last hopes with pious COWPER sleep?\nUnless, perchance, from his cold bier she turns,\nTo deck the turf that wraps her minstrel, BURNS!\nNo! though contempt hath marked the spurious brood,\nThe race who rhyme from folly, or for food,\nYet still some genuine sons 'tis hers to boast,\nWho, least affecting, still affect the most: \nFeel as they write, and write but as they feel\u2014\nBear witness GIFFORD,  SOTHEBY,  MACNEIL. \n\"Why slumbers GIFFORD?\" once was asked in vain;\nWhy slumbers GIFFORD? let us ask again. \nAre there no follies for his pen to purge?\nAre there no fools whose backs demand the scourge?\nAre there no sins for Satire's Bard to greet?\nStalks not gigantic Vice in every street?\nShall Peers or Princes tread pollution's path,\nAnd 'scape alike the Laws and Muse's wrath?\nNor blaze with guilty glare through future time,\nEternal beacons of consummate crime?\nArouse thee, GIFFORD! be thy promise claimed,\nMake bad men better, or at least ashamed.\nUnhappy WHITE!  while life was in its spring,\nAnd thy young Muse just waved her joyous wing,\nThe Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away,  \nWhich else had sounded an immortal lay.\nOh! what a noble heart was here undone,\nWhen Science' self destroyed her favourite son!\nYes, she too much indulged thy fond pursuit,\nShe sowed the seeds, but Death has reaped the fruit.\n'Twas thine own Genius gave the final blow,\nAnd helped to plant the wound that laid thee low:\nSo the struck Eagle, stretched upon the plain,\nNo more through rolling clouds to soar again,\nViewed his own feather on the fatal dart,\nAnd winged the shaft that quivered in his heart;\nKeen were his pangs, but keener far to feel\nHe nursed the pinion which impelled the steel;\nWhile the same plumage that had warmed his nest\nDrank the last life-drop of his bleeding breast.\nThere be who say, in these enlightened days,\nThat splendid lies are all the poet's praise;\nThat strained Invention, ever on the wing,\nAlone impels the modern Bard to sing:\nTis true, that all who rhyme\u2014nay, all who write,\nShrink from that fatal word to Genius\u2014Trite;\nYet Truth sometimes will lend her noblest fires,\nAnd decorate the verse herself inspires:\nThis fact in Virtue's name let CRABBE  attest;\nThough Nature's sternest Painter, yet the best.\nAnd here let SHEE  and Genius find a place,\nWhose pen and pencil yield an equal grace;\nTo guide whose hand the sister Arts combine,\nAnd trace the Poet's or the Painter's line;\nWhose magic touch can bid the canvas glow,\nOr pour the easy rhyme's harmonious flow;\nWhile honours, doubly merited, attend \nThe Poet's rival, but the Painter's friend.\nBlest is the man who dares approach the bower\nWhere dwelt the Muses at their natal hour;\nWhose steps have pressed, whose eye has marked afar,\nThe clime that nursed the sons of song and war,\nThe scenes which Glory still must hover o'er,\nHer place of birth, her own Achaian shore.\nBut doubly blest is he whose heart expands\nWith hallowed feelings for those classic lands;\nWho rends the veil of ages long gone by,\nAnd views their remnants with a poet's eye!\nWRIGHT!  'twas thy happy lot at once to view\nThose shores of glory, and to sing them too;\nAnd sure no common Muse inspired thy pen\nTo hail the land of Gods and Godlike men. 880\nAnd you, associate Bards!  who snatched to light \nThose gems too long withheld from modern sight;\nWhose mingling taste combined to cull the wreath\nWhile Attic flowers Aonian odours breathe,\nAnd all their renovated fragrance flung,\nTo grace the beauties of your native tongue;\nNow let those minds, that nobly could transfuse\nThe glorious Spirit of the Grecian Muse,\nThough soft the echo, scorn a borrowed tone: \nResign Achaia's lyre, and strike your own.\nLet these, or such as these, with just applause, \nRestore the Muse's violated laws;\nBut not in flimsy DARWIN'S  pompous chime, \nThat mighty master of unmeaning rhyme,\nWhose gilded cymbals, more adorned than clear,\nThe eye delighted, but fatigued the ear,\nIn show the simple lyre could once surpass,\nBut now, worn down, appear in native brass;\nWhile all his train of hovering sylphs around\nEvaporate in similes and sound:\nHim let them shun, with him let tinsel die:\nFalse glare attracts, but more offends the eye. \nYet let them not to vulgar WORDSWORTH  stoop,\nThe meanest object of the lowly group,\nWhose verse, of all but childish prattle void,\nSeems blessed harmony to LAMB and LLOYD: \nLet them\u2014but hold, my Muse, nor dare to teach\nA strain far, far beyond thy humble reach:\nThe native genius with their being given\nWill point the path, and peal their notes to heaven. 910\nAnd thou, too, SCOTT!  resign to minstrels rude\nThe wilder Slogan of a Border feud:\nLet others spin their meagre lines for hire;\nEnough for Genius, if itself inspire!\nLet SOUTHEY sing, altho' his teeming muse, \nProlific every spring, be too profuse;\nLet simple WORDSWORTH  chime his childish verse,\nAnd brother COLERIDGE lull the babe at nurse \nLet Spectre-mongering LEWIS aim, at most, \nTo rouse the Galleries, or to raise a ghost;\nLet MOORE still sigh; let STRANGFORD steal from MOORE, \nAnd swear that CAMOËNS sang such notes of yore;\nLet HAYLEY hobble on, MONTGOMERY rave,\nAnd godly GRAHAME chant a stupid stave;\nLet sonneteering BOWLES  his strains refine,\nAnd whine and whimper to the fourteenth line;\nLet STOTT, CARLISLE,  MATILDA, and the rest\nOf Grub Street, and of Grosvenor Place the best,\nScrawl on, 'till death release us from the strain,\nOr Common Sense assert her rights again;\nBut Thou, with powers that mock the aid of praise,\nShould'st leave to humbler Bards ignoble lays:\nThy country's voice, the voice of all the Nine,\nDemand a hallowed harp\u2014that harp is thine.\nSay! will not Caledonia's annals yield\nThe glorious record of some nobler field,\nThan the vile foray of a plundering clan,\nWhose proudest deeds disgrace the name of man?\nOr Marmion's acts of darkness, fitter food\nFor SHERWOOD'S outlaw tales of ROBIN HOOD? \nScotland! still proudly claim thy native Bard,\nAnd be thy praise his first, his best reward!\nYet not with thee alone his name should live,\nBut own the vast renown a world can give;\nBe known, perchance, when Albion is no more,\nAnd tell the tale of what she was before;\nTo future times her faded fame recall,\nAnd save her glory, though his country fall.\nYet what avails the sanguine Poet's hope,\nTo conquer ages, and with time to cope?\nNew eras spread their wings, new nations rise,\nAnd other Victors fill th' applauding skies; \nA few brief generations fleet along,\nWhose sons forget the Poet and his song:\nE'en now, what once-loved Minstrels scarce may claim\nThe transient mention of a dubious name!\nWhen Fame's loud trump hath blown its noblest blast,\nThough long the sound, the echo sleeps at last;\nAnd glory, like the Phoenix  midst her fires,\nExhales her odours, blazes, and expires.\nShall hoary Granta call her sable sons,\nExpert in science, more expert at puns?\nShall these approach the Muse? ah, no! she flies,\nEven from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize; \nThough Printers condescend the press to soil\nWith rhyme by HOARE,  and epic blank by HOYLE:  \nNot him whose page, if still upheld by whist,\nRequires no sacred theme to bid us list. \nYe! who in Granta's honours would surpass,\nMust mount her Pegasus, a full-grown ass;\nA foal well worthy of her ancient Dam,\nWhose Helicon  is duller than her Cam. \nThere CLARKE,  still striving piteously \"to please,\" \nForgetting doggerel leads not to degrees,\nA would-be satirist, a hired Buffoon,\nA monthly scribbler of some low Lampoon, \nCondemned to drudge, the meanest of the mean,\nAnd furbish falsehoods for a magazine,\nDevotes to scandal his congenial mind;\nHimself a living libel on mankind.\nOh! dark asylum of a Vandal race! \nAt once the boast of learning, and disgrace!\nSo lost to Phoebus, that nor Hodgson's  verse\nCan make thee better, nor poor Hewson's  worse. \nBut where fair Isis rolls her purer wave,\nThe partial Muse delighted loves to lave;\nOn her green banks a greener wreath she wove, \nTo crown the Bards that haunt her classic grove;\nWhere RICHARDS wakes a genuine poet's fires,\nAnd modern Britons glory in their Sires.  \nFor me, who, thus unasked, have dared to tell\nMy country, what her sons should know too well, \nZeal for her honour bade me here engage \nThe host of idiots that infest her age;\nNo just applause her honoured name shall lose,\nAs first in freedom, dearest to the Muse.\nOh! would thy bards but emulate thy fame,\nAnd rise more worthy, Albion, of thy name!\nWhat Athens was in science, Rome in power,\nWhat Tyre appeared in her meridian hour,\n'Tis thine at once, fair Albion! to have been\u2014\nEarth's chief Dictatress, Ocean's lovely Queen: \nBut Rome decayed, and Athens strewed the plain,\nAnd Tyre's proud piers lie shattered in the main;\nLike these, thy strength may sink, in ruin hurled, \nAnd Britain fall, the bulwark of the world.\nBut let me cease, and dread Cassandra's fate,\nWith warning ever scoffed at, till too late;\nTo themes less lofty still my lay confine,\nAnd urge thy Bards to gain a name like thine. \nThen, hapless Britain! be thy rulers blest,\nThe senate's oracles, the people's jest!\nStill hear thy motley orators dispense\nThe flowers of rhetoric, though not of sense,\nWhile CANNING'S colleagues hate him for his wit,\nAnd old dame PORTLAND  fills the place of PITT.\nYet once again, adieu! ere this the sail\nThat wafts me hence is shivering in the gale;\nAnd Afric's coast and Calpe's adverse height, \nAnd Stamboul's minarets must greet my sight:\nThence shall I stray through Beauty's native clime, \nWhere Kaff  is clad in rocks, and crowned with snows sublime.\nBut should I back return, no tempting press \nShall drag my Journal from the desk's recess;\nLet coxcombs, printing as they come from far,\nSnatch his own wreath of Ridicule from Carr;\nLet ABERDEEN and ELGIN  still pursue\nThe shade of fame through regions of Virtù;\nWaste useless thousands on their Phidian freaks,\nMisshapen monuments and maimed antiques;\nAnd make their grand saloons a general mart\nFor all the mutilated blocks of art:\nOf Dardan tours let Dilettanti tell,\nI leave topography to rapid  GELL; \nAnd, quite content, no more shall interpose\nTo stun the public ear\u2014at least with Prose. \nThus far I've held my undisturbed career,\nPrepared for rancour, steeled 'gainst selfish fear;\nThis thing of rhyme I ne'er disdained to own\u2014\nThough not obtrusive, yet not quite unknown:\nMy voice was heard again, though not so loud,\nMy page, though nameless, never disavowed;\nAnd now at once I tear the veil away:\u2014\nCheer on the pack! the Quarry stands at bay,\nUnscared by all the din of MELBOURNE house, \nBy LAMB'S resentment, or by HOLLAND'S spouse,\nBy JEFFREY'S harmless pistol, HALLAM'S rage,\nEdina's brawny sons and brimstone page.\nOur men in buckram shall have blows enough,\nAnd feel they too are \"penetrable stuff:\"\nAnd though I hope not hence unscathed to go,\nWho conquers me shall find a stubborn foe.\nThe time hath been, when no harsh sound would fall\nFrom lips that now may seem imbued with gall;\nNor fools nor follies tempt me to despise\nThe meanest thing that crawled beneath my eyes:\nBut now, so callous grown, so changed since youth,\nI've learned to think, and sternly speak the truth;\nLearned to deride the critic's starch decree,\nAnd break him on the wheel he meant for me;\nTo spurn the rod a scribbler bids me kiss,\nNor care if courts and crowds applaud or hiss:\nNay more, though all my rival rhymesters frown,\nI too can hunt a Poetaster down;\nAnd, armed in proof, the gauntlet cast at once\nTo Scotch marauder, and to Southern dunce.\nThus much I've dared; if my incondite lay \nHath wronged these righteous times, let others say:\nThis, let the world, which knows not how to spare,\nYet rarely blames unjustly, now declare. \n\n\n]\n{Sub-Footnote 0.1: Compare 'Hints from Horace', l. 808, 'note' 1.}\n\n\n\n, that is the farce; the ingenuous youth who begat it is mentioned more particularly with his offspring in another place.  \n\n\n\n\"This was not just.

Then we have the amiable William of Deloraine, \"a stark moss-trooper,\" videlicet, a happy compound of poacher, sheep-stealer, and highwayman. The propriety of his magical lady's injunction not to read can only be equalled by his candid acknowledgment of his independence of the trammels of spelling, although, to use his own elegant phrase, \"'twas his neckverse at Harribee,\" 'i. e.' the gallows.\nThe biography of Gilpin Horner, and the marvellous pedestrian page, who travelled twice as fast as his master's horse, without the aid of seven-leagued boots, are 'chefs d'oeuvre' in the improvement of taste. For incident we have the invisible, but by no means sparing box on the ear bestowed on the page, and the entrance of a Knight and Charger into the castle, under the very natural disguise of a wain of hay. Marmion, the hero of the latter romance, is exactly what William of Deloraine would have been, had he been able to read and write. The poem was manufactured for Messrs. CONSTABLE, MURRAY, and MILLER, worshipful Booksellers, in consideration of the receipt of a sum of money; and truly, considering the inspiration, it is a very creditable production.
